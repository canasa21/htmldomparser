The waste, which is no longer produced, resulted from radium and  uranium refining by a former federal Crown corporation (Eldorado Nuclear) and  its private-sector predecessors from the 1930s to 1980s. The <a href="http://www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/waste/historic-nuclear-waste/port-hope-area-initiative/index.cfm">Port Hope Area Initiative (PHAI)</a>, a community-initiated  environmental remediation, is currently underway and will ensure the cleanup  and safe long-term management of historic low-level waste within these  municipalities. </p>  <p>Through its Historic Waste Program  Management Office, <a href="http://www.cnl.ca/en/home/environmental-stewardship/phai.aspx#_blank">Canadian  Nuclear Laboratories</a> (CNL) is implementing the PHAI on behalf of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, a  federal Crown corporation. CNL is responsible for both of the PHAI projects &ndash; the Port Hope Project in the Municipality of Port Hope, and the Port Granby  Project in the Municipality of Clarington. CNL is  currently licensed by the CNSC to operate existing waste management facilities  in Port Hope (Welcome Waste Management Facility) and in Clarington (Port Granby  Waste Management Facility), which are being replaced with new, advanced  technology facilities as part of the PHAI.</p>  <p>CNL currently supports the PHAI MO through its interim waste management program,  and will continue to do so until waste management activities are completed. CNL currently operates the Pine Street Extension Temporary Storage Site,  which is a low-level radioactive waste management facility licensed to receive  historic radioactive waste from construction activities within the  municipality. The waste at this site will eventually be transferred into the  new Long-Term Waste Management Facility that is being constructed for the Port  Hope Project.</p>  	    <h2 id="Toronto">Toronto area</h2>    <p>The low-level contamination in the Toronto  area comes from production of radioluminescent dials.</p>    <p>Contaminated sites include radium-contaminated soils on lands owned by the province of Ontario and private landowners, as well as radium contamination of structural elements in privately owned buildings.</p>    <p>The contaminated soils are generally covered or occur in areas of low use (primarily open space).</p>    <p>The owners of the private properties are aware of these control measures, and the tenants are restricted from construction activities that would compromise these safeguards.</p>    <p>The owners are also aware that they are required to contact the CNSC to assess any proposed construction or land-use changes.</p>    <p>The CNSC maintains contact with the owners/managers of the sites through visits and phone conversations and conducts site visits once every three years.</p>    <div class="span-3 float-right">      <div class="module-poster"> <img src="/images/waste/historic-nuclear-waste/Eldorado.JPG" alt="" />        <div class="image-caption">          <p>Building and storage tanks at Eldorado radium mine, Great Bear Lake (1936)</p>        </div>      </div>    </div>        <h2 id="Northern">Northern sites</h2>    <p>From the early 1930s to the 1950s, uranium ore was transported over 2,200 km by the Northern Transportation Route (NTR) from Port Radium (on Great Bear Lake, Northwest Territories) to the railhead at Waterways (now Fort McMurray, Alberta).</p>    <p>In the 1990s, AECL&rsquo;s Low-Level Radioactive Waste  Management Office (LLRWMO) identified sites impacted by uranium ore along the  NTR. The contamination was located primarily  in docks and boat launches.</p>    <p>Radiological surveys conducted in 2004, 2005 and 2006 determined the volume of the waste to be approximately 10,000 cubic metres. Following these surveys the LLRWMO removed and consolidated  most of the higher-density, uranium-impacted soil from the identified  locations.</p>    <p>CNL is in charge of continuing to address the historic nuclear waste in Canada's north.</p>    <p>It is adapting methods of community engagement and technical approaches that have led to successful remediation projects in Canada's southern regions.</p>  </div>

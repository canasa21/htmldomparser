<h3>Preface</h3>  <p>A safety assessment is a systematic process to verify that applicable safety   requirements are met in all phases of the life cycle of a Class I nuclear   facility. Safety analysis is a key component of a safety assessment. Safety   analysis incorporates both probabilistic and deterministic approaches, which   complement each other.</p>  <p>Deterministic safety analysis is the principal means of demonstrating that   the dose acceptance criteria and safety goals are met with a high degree of   confidence for all accidents within the design basis.</p>  <p>Probabilistic safety analysis is the principal means of demonstrating that   the safety goals are met for potential accidents both within and beyond the   design basis. It identifies vulnerabilities not necessarily accessible through   deterministic safety analysis alone.</p>  <p>With the development of probabilistic analysis techniques, Class I nuclear   facilities licensees and applicants have introduced probabilistic arguments in   support of applications for a licence to operate as well as submissions aimed at   obtaining approval for facility modifications, for closure of action items, or   for temporary licence exemptions. </p>  <p>This document informs Class I nuclear facilities licensees and applicants of   the criteria CNSC uses to assess submissions that use both deterministic and   probabilistic arguments.</p>  <p>Nothing contained in this document is to be construed as relieving any   applicant from the requirements of any pertinent regulations. It is the   applicant&rsquo;s responsibility to identify and comply with any applicable   legislation or licence conditions.</p>

<h3><a name="P100_8811" id="P100_8811"></a>2.0 Safety Analysis</h3>
<a name="2.1"></a>
<h4><a name="P101_8830" id="P101_8830"></a>2.1 General Information</h4>  <p>Safety analysis involves deterministic and probabilistic analyses in support   of the siting, design, commissioning, operation, or decommissioning of a Class I   nuclear facility.</p>  <p>In accordance with subsection 24(4) of the <em>Nuclear Safety and Control Act</em>,   the applicant is required to demonstrate that they are qualified to carry on the   activity authorized by the licence and that in carrying on that activity that   they will make adequate provision for the protection of the environment, health   and safety of persons.</p>  <p>For new nuclear power plants the technical safety objective of RD-337, <em>Design of New Nuclear Power Plants</em> provides expectations related to the   requirement for licensees and applicants to make adequate provision for the   protection of the environment and health and safety of persons. The technical   safety objective is the basis for the following criteria and goals: </p>  <ol>
<li> Dose acceptance criteria for events within the design basis; and </li>
<li> Safety goals for beyond design basis accidents.</li>  </ol>  <p>Similar criteria and goals may be established for other types of Class I   nuclear facilities.</p>  <p>Safety analyses are performed to confirm that these fundamental criteria and   goals are met, to demonstrate effectiveness of measures for preventing   accidents, and mitigating radiological consequences of accidents if they do   occur.</p>
<a name="2.2"></a>
<h4><a name="P109_10165" id="P109_10165"></a>2.2 Deterministic Safety Analysis</h4>  <p>For Class I nuclear facilities, deterministic safety analysis focuses on   evaluating the consequences of various events to confirm that the dose   acceptance criteria are met. This includes demonstrating the efficiency of   defence in depth and the integrity of protective barriers. In the case of   nuclear power plants, RD-310, <em>Safety Analysis for Nuclear Power Plants</em>,   sets out the requirements related to safety analysis, including the selection of   events to be analyzed, acceptance criteria, safety analysis methods, and safety   analysis documentation and review. </p>  <p>The objectives of deterministic analysis are given in RD-310 as:</p>  <ol>
<li> Confirm that the design of the facility meets design and safety   requirements;</li>
<li> Derive or confirm operational limits and conditions that are consistent   with the design and safety requirements for the facility;</li>
<li> Assist in establishing and validating accident management procedures and   guidelines; and</li>
<li> Assist in demonstrating that safety goals, which may be established to   limit the risks posed by the facility, are met.</li>  </ol>  <p>The licensee is responsible for identifying and classifying a set of events   that covers all credible accident sequences for the facility. Identification of   these events uses a variety of methods, including probabilistic analysis. </p>  <p>These events are analysed to demonstrate that the appropriate regulatory   limits are met. For new reactor designs, the high level expectations (the dose   acceptance criteria) are given in RD-337, <em>Design of New Nuclear Power   Plants</em>, and are reproduced in Appendix&nbsp;A.</p>  <p>To simplify the analysis, the design or operating organization selects more   restrictive limits, often referred to as derived acceptance criteria or   decoupling criteria. Meeting these criteria is a sufficient condition to   demonstrate meeting the dose acceptance criteria. For example, showing that   there is no damage to any of the barriers to fission product release is   sufficient to show that there will be no offsite dose, so the dose acceptance   criteria are met. Failure to meet the derived acceptance criteria does not   necessarily mean that dose acceptance criteria will be exceeded, but additional   justification is necessary.</p>  <p>As described in RD-310, <em>Safety Analysis for Nuclear Power Plants</em>,   deterministic analysis of Anticipated Operational Occurrences (AOOs) and Design   Basis Accidents (DBAs) is performed in a conservative manner. For Beyond Design   Basis Accidents (BDBAs), less conservative assumptions may be used. </p>
<a name="2.3"></a>
<h4><a name="P120_12699" id="P120_12699"></a>2.3 Probabilistic Safety Analysis</h4>  <p>Probabilistic safety analysis focuses on   evaluating the risk arising from various events to confirm that safety goals are   met. In the case of nuclear power plants, the requirements for probabilistic   safety analysis are provided in regulatory standard S-294, <em>Probabilistic   Safety Assessment (PSA) for Nuclear Power Plants.</em></p>  <p>The objectives of the probabilistic safety analysis are to:</p>  <ol>
<li> Evaluate the frequencies of severe accidents to the core (for nuclear   reactors) and of severe releases, and compare them to the safety goals;</li>
<li> Evaluate the effect of facility or operational modifications on the   frequency of accidents;</li>
<li> Evaluate the effectiveness of defence in depth; and</li>
<li> Evaluate the impact of post-accident management on the frequency of   releases.</li>  </ol>  <p>Probabilistic analyses are performed using &ldquo;best estimate&rdquo; data and   assumptions, and consider all existing plant systems to provide a realistic risk   prediction.</p>
<a name="2.4"></a>
<h4><a name="P128_13680" id="P128_13680"></a>2.4 Safety Goals for Nuclear Power Plants</h4>  <p>RD-337, <em>Design of New Nuclear Power Plants</em>, provides direction   concerning the establishment of safety goals for the design of a nuclear power   plant. Two qualitative safety goals have been established:</p>  <ol>
<li> Individual members of the public are provided a level of protection from   the consequences of nuclear power plant operation such that there is no   significant additional risk to the life and health of individuals; and</li>
<li> Societal risks to life and health from nuclear power plant operation are   comparable to or less than the risks of generating electricity by viable   competing technologies, and should not be a significant addition to other   societal risks.</li>  </ol>  <p>Quantitative safety goals for existing nuclear power plants are set to   achieve the intent of these qualitative goals. Quantitative safety goals are   categorized into three frequency types:</p>  <ol>
<li> <strong>Core Damage Frequency (CDF)</strong>: The sum of frequencies of all event sequences   that can lead to significant core degradation.</li>
<li> <strong>Small Release Frequency (SRF)</strong>: The sum of frequencies of all event   sequences that can lead to such a release that may require temporary evacuation   of the local population.</li>
<li> <strong>Large Release Frequency (LRF)</strong>: The sum of frequencies of all event   sequences that can lead to such a release that may require long term relocation   of the local population.</li>  </ol>  <p>The above safety goals include the contribution of facility-originated events   (such as equipment failure, operator errors, internal fire, and internal floods)   and external events (such as earthquakes, weather-originated events, and fire),   but exclude malevolent acts.</p>  <p>The numerical values for these goals are found in Appendix B.1 and B.2.</p>

<h3><a name="P138_15374" id="P138_15374"></a>3.0 Submission Review</h3>
<a name="3.1"></a>
<h4><a name="P139_15395" id="P139_15395"></a>3.1 General Information</h4>  <p>The depth and scope of the review of a submission is in proportion to its   impact on safety. When a submission is supported by both deterministic and   probabilistic arguments, the review is conducted as a multidisciplinary   project.</p>  <p>The goal of the review is to check that the following general principles are   met:</p>  <ol>
<li> The status of the facility after implementation of the decision meets the   relevant regulations and the current licence requirements;</li>
<li> Defence in depth is maintained; and</li>
<li> Sufficient safety margins are maintained.</li>  </ol>  <p>The approach used for evaluating the safety impact of the submission is to   ensure that all aspects of the submission have been addressed. Specialists of   both deterministic and probabilistic safety analysis, facility operation,   systems, maintenance, management, training, radiation protection, human factors,   organizational factors, and software reliability are consulted as appropriate. </p>  <p>The review of the submission takes into account probabilistic and   deterministic considerations, current regulatory requirements, and licence   conditions. Information and insights from the probabilistic and deterministic   analyses are considered, together with quantitative sensitivity studies,   operational experience, historical facility performance, and engineering   judgment.</p>  <p>The scope and quality of the analyses conducted to justify the submission are   assessed for the appropriateness for the nature and scope of the proposal(s)   contained therein and whether it is based on the as-built and as-operated   facility. The assumptions and elements of the models used are assessed for   whether they are correct and adequate for resolving the issue. Furthermore, it   must be clear that there is a commitment to perform the diverse activities   (monitoring, surveillance, operating and maintenance procedures, etc.) that are   credited in the submission. </p>
<a name="3.2"></a>
<h4><a name="P148_17272" id="P148_17272"></a>3.2 Use of Safety Goals</h4>  <p>The probabilistic arguments supporting the licensee&rsquo;s submissions include an   evaluation of the absolute or relative change in risk metrics. The complexity   and depth of this evaluation depends on the magnitude of the potential risk   impact.</p>  <p>The results from the PSA, after modelling the proposal(s), are evaluated   against the safety goals. The margin between the presented results (for example   in terms of core damage or releases) and the safety goal limits is used to weigh   the probabilistic and deterministic arguments.</p>  <p>The result of the evaluation of the PSA against the safety goals will   identify that the facility is in one of the following categories:</p>  <ol>
<li> Frequency more than one decade<a href="#P153_17983" name="P153_17984" id="P153_17984"><sup>1</sup></a> lower than the safety goal;</li>
<li> Frequency between the goal and one decade lower than the goal; or</li>
<li> Frequency greater than the goal.</li>  </ol>  <hr className="footer" />  <p><a href="#P153_17984" name="P153_17983" id="P153_17983"><sup>1</sup></a> A difference of a   factor of ten. For example, the difference between 10<sup>-6</sup> and   10<sup>-5</sup> is one decade.</p>
<a name="3.2.1"></a>
<h5><a name="P156_18214" id="P156_18214"></a>3.2.1 Frequency more than one decade lower than the   safety goal</h5>  <p>If the review of the submissions reveals that the facility meets the safety   goal with a margin of more than one decade, measures to further reduce the   identified safety risk are not expected and all normal licensing conditions   apply.</p>
<a name="3.2.2"></a>
<h5><a name="P158_18510" id="P158_18510"></a>3.2.2 Frequency between the goal and one decade lower   than the goal</h5>  <p>If the review of the submission reveals that the facility is within one   decade of the safety goal, the licensee is expected to identify measures to   reduce the identified safety risk.</p>  <p>The principle of As Low as Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) is used to   determine the practical course of action. For a risk to be ALARP, the cost to   further reduce the identified risk must be grossly disproportionate to the   improvement in safety. Cost benefit assessment can be used to evaluate and   select appropriate options to reduce the risk. The effort applied and cost   incurred to reduce the risk should be in proportion to the deviation from the   safety goal.</p>
<a name="3.2.3"></a>
<h5><a name="P161_19221" id="P161_19221"></a>3.2.3 Frequency greater than the goal</h5>  <p>If the review of the submission reveals that the facility does not meet the   safety goal, compensatory measures to reduce the identified safety risk will be   required in order to comply with relevant regulations and licence   conditions.</p>
<a name="3.3"></a>
<h4><a name="P163_19491" id="P163_19491"></a>3.3 Supporting Documentation</h4>  <p>Data, methods, assessment criteria, and analyses used to support any proposed   modification should be available for review, along with all appropriate   documentation, including justification of the assumptions. The source of data   and assumptions should also be available for review.</p>  <p>CNSC staff may choose to independently reproduce the results of the analysis,   and modify the models, data, and assumptions presented in the submission.   Sufficient information should be available to support this activity.</p>  <p>During the review of a submission, deficiencies in the analysis and the   models, or indications of facility weaknesses (for instance, features weakening   defence in depth) may be detected. The licensee should provide any requested   clarification or perform any necessary corrective action.</p>  <p>Such clarification or corrective action may include:</p>  <ol>
<li> For the analysis and models:
<ol className="alphalower">
<li> More analysis on an issue or a specific part of the analysis;</li>
<li> Correction of defective parts of the analysis; and</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li> For the facility:
<ol className="alphalower">
<li> Modification of the facility configuration to correct weaknesses in its   defence in depth or safety margins; and</li>
<li> Modification of the operating policies and procedures to improve the   safety margins or reduce uncertainty.</li>

<h3><a name="P221_23122" id="P221_23122"></a>Glossary</h3>  <p><strong>Acceptance criteria</strong><br />  Specified bounds on the value of a functional or conditional indicator used   to assess the ability of a structure, system, or component to meet its design   and safety requirements. </p>  <p><strong>ALARP (As Low as Reasonably Practicable)</strong><br />  Risk should be reduced when it does not result in a cost disproportionate   with the effective improvement. </p>  <p><strong>Anticipated operational occurrence (AOO)</strong><br />  Operational process deviating from normal operation, such as the loss of   normal electrical power, which is expected to occur at least once during the   operating lifetime of a facility but which, in view of appropriate design   provisions, does not cause any significant damage to items important to safety   or lead to accident conditions.</p>  <p><strong>Beyond design basis accident (BDBA)</strong><br />  Accident conditions less frequent and more severe than a Design Basis   Accident (DBA). For a nuclear reactor a BDBA may or may not involve core   degradation.</p>  <p><strong>Design basis accident (DBA)</strong><br />  Accident conditions against which a facility is designed according to   established design criteria, and for which the damage to the fuel and the   release of radioactive material are kept within authorized limits.</p>  <p><strong>Deterministic Safety Analysis</strong><br />  Analysis of responses to an event; performed using predetermined rules and   assumptions (e.g., those concerning the initial operational state, availability   and performance of the systems and operator actions). Deterministic analysis can   use either conservative or best estimate methods.</p>  <p><strong>Nuclear power plant (NPP, plant)</strong><br />  Any fission-reactor installation that has been constructed to generate   electricity on a commercial scale. A nuclear power plant is a Class IA nuclear   facility, as defined in the <em>Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations</em>. For the   purposes of this document we have differentiated nuclear power plants as   follows:</p>  <p className="indent">(1) Existing nuclear power plant - an NPP first licensed before 2008.<br />  (2) New nuclear power plant &ndash; an NPP first licensed after 2008.</p><p><strong>Probabilistic Safety Assessment (PSA)</strong><br />
For any Class I facility, a comprehensive and integrated assessment of the   safety of the facility. The probabilistic safety assessment considers the   probability, progression, and consequences of equipment failures or transient   conditions to derive numerical estimates that provide a consistent measure of   the safety of the facility. <br />
For a nuclear reactor the PSA is generally   structured as follows:</p>  <p className="indent">(1) A Level 1 PSA identifies and quantifies the sequences of events that may   lead to the loss of core structural integrity and to massive fuel failures;<br />  (2) A Level 2 PSA starts from the Level 1 results, and analyses the   containment behaviour, evaluates the radionuclides released from the failed   fuel, and quantifies the releases to the environment; and<br />  (3) A Level 3 PSA starts from the Level 2 results, and analyses the   distribution of radionuclides in the environment and evaluates the resulting   effect on public health.</p><p>A PSA may also be referred to as a Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA). </p>  <p><strong>Safety analysis</strong><br />  Analysis by means of appropriate analytical tools that establishes and   confirms the design basis for the items important to safety; ensures that the   overall plant design is capable of meeting the acceptance criteria for each   plant state.</p>

March 5, 2021</p>  <h2>Introduction: CNSC Values and Ethics Code </h2>  <p>As part of the team of CNSC officers and employees, you have  a number of important rights and responsibilities.</p>  <p>Among them: You are expected to embrace and embody positive  values and ethics in order to earn and maintain the trust of your colleagues  and Canadians. </p>  <h3>What are the requirements I must comply with under this Code?</h3>  <p>At the CNSC, we are committed to the values of <strong>Respect</strong>, <strong>Integrity</strong>, <strong>Service</strong>, <strong>Excellence</strong>, <strong>Responsibility</strong> and <strong>Safety</strong> &ndash; often referred to collectively as <strong>RISERS</strong>.</p>  <p>As part of the CNSC team, you must:</p>  <ul>
<li><strong>Respect</strong> the rights and contributions of your colleagues and all those with whom you  interact. This includes treating colleagues, stakeholders, Indigenous peoples  and all Canadians with dignity and fairness.</li>
<li>Act with <strong>integrity</strong> in all that you do, striving to be honest and working continuously to earn the  rights and privileges that a trusting relationship brings. This includes  ensuring that your advice and decisions are grounded in evidence and that you  avoid real, apparent and potential conflicts of interest. It also includes  speaking out when made aware of wrongdoing &ndash; and never abusing your authority.</li>
<li>Commit to being of <strong>service</strong> to Canadians and the government, to the very best of your  abilities. Canadians should feel confident that you are acting in their best  interests. This includes judiciously managing public money, travel funds,  property and resources entrusted to the CNSC &ndash; as well as respecting and  protecting personal and confidential information.</li>
<li>Strive for <strong>excellence</strong> in your work. This includes being dedicated, competent and professional &ndash; and  continually seeking to improve the quality of the CNSC&rsquo;s policies, programs and  services. It also includes carrying out your duties in a non-partisan and  objective manner, providing decision makers with the information, analysis and  advice needed to reach a fully informed conclusion.</li>
<li>Make an ongoing commitment to personal and  professional <strong>responsibility</strong>. This  includes engaging in honest, authentic &ndash; and respectful &ndash; conversation, raising  pertinent issues, seeking out divergent and dissenting views, and listening  actively to the perspectives of others. It also includes avoiding inappropriate  behaviour, such as rudeness, bullying, intimidation, sexual harassment,  perceived threats, and physical violence. </li>
<li>Promote and adhere to a strong culture of <strong>safety</strong> so that the CNSC can achieve its  mandated responsibilities. This includes taking appropriate measures to ensure  health and safety in the workplace.</li>  </ul>  <p>In addition to compliance with these RISERS, you must:</p>  <ul>
<li>Contribute to the realization of a diverse and  inclusive workplace &ndash; ensure that the CNSC is representative of Canadian  society by being open to the experiences of others and expanding your knowledge  and perspective to make sure that each one of us feels able to contribute  successfully to the mandate of the CNSC. </li>
<li>Know that the Canadian Human Rights Act  prohibits discrimination on the grounds of race, national or ethnic origin,  colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression,  marital status, family status, genetic characteristics, disability and  conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of  which a record suspension has been ordered.</li>
<li>Speak up if you witness or experience violence,  harassment or discrimination &ndash; or if you have information that could indicate a  serious breach of this Code. Such matters can be raised without fear of  reprisal to a supervisor, the Senior  Officer for Disclosure, Labour Relations, Legal Services and/or  Corporate Security, or the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner.</li>  </ul>  <p>The <strong><em>Canada Labour Code</em></strong> requires  employers to <strong>investigate, record and  report all accidents, occurrences of harassment and violence, occupational  illnesses and other hazardous incidents</strong> known to the employer. Recent  amendments to the <strong><em>Canada Labour Code</em></strong> strengthened the existing framework for the  prevention of workplace harassment and violence &ndash; including sexual harassment  and sexual violence.</p>  <h3>What does this mean? </h3>  <p>It means:</p>  <ul>
<li>these values and behaviours are conditions of  employment </li>
<li>you must be honest and respectful</li>
<li>you must demonstrate integrity and responsibility</li>
<li>you must be committed to safety, excellence and  service</li>
<li>you can expect to be treated in accordance with  this Code</li>  </ul>  <p>These are not mere words. At the CNSC, we do important work.  Canadians have put their trust and confidence in us. We must at all times act  in a manner that honours their trust and earns their confidence. </p>  <p>Only if we demonstrate our commitment to the highest values  and ethics will we be deserving of the trust of Canadians and our co-workers.</p>  <p>To fulfill our mandate as a regulator, we must create and  maintain an environment where people speak freely, fearlessly and candidly &ndash;  but also respectfully. Not always agreeing with one another is OK, if done  constructively.</p>  <p>At the CNSC, we do not tolerate violence, harassment or  discrimination. If you witness or experience violence, harassment or  discrimination, it is your responsibility to raise it immediately or when it is  safe to do so. </p>  <p>Do not hesitate. It is your duty. You will be supported.</p>  <p>Together, we have a responsibility to protect the safety of  Canadians and the environment. We take that responsibility seriously. We are  all here with the same dedication to the safety of Canadians.</p>  <p>And we also have a responsibility to each other &ndash; to make  this a supportive, enjoyable, productive and inclusive workplace. </p>  <p>We fulfill this responsibility when we exemplify a culture  of integrity, ethics, safety and respect, and model trustworthy behaviour &ndash; and  when, in our words and actions, we are guided by our values.</p>  <h3>Who is the Code for?</h3>  <p>This Code applies to every officer and employee of the CNSC.  Along with the internal and external programs and policies listed below, this  Code outlines the values and behaviours we each commit to as officers and  employees of the CNSC.</p>  <h3>What are the Code&rsquo;s objectives?</h3>  <p>The Code aims to: </p>  <ul>

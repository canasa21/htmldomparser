The Commission</h2> <p>The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (“the Commission” or “the CNSC”) is a body corporate established by the <cite>Nuclear Safety and Control Act</cite> (NSCA). The NSCA establishes the objects of the Commission, which are to:</p> <ul>   <li>regulate the development, production and use of nuclear energy and the production, possession and use of nuclear substances, prescribed equipment and prescribed information to prevent unreasonable risk to the environment, national security and to the health and safety of persons, and</li>   <li>disseminate objective scientific, technical and regulatory information to the public concerning the activities of the Commission and the effects on the environment and on the health and safety of persons, of the development, production and use of nuclear energy, nuclear substances, prescribed equipment and prescribed information.</li> </ul> <p>The Commission consists of not more than seven permanent, full-time or part-time members appointed by the Governor in Council. One of the members is designated as President and is a full-time member. Each permanent member holds office during good behaviour for a term not exceeding five years. Commission members come from across Canada and represent various scientific and business backgrounds. In addition to President Velshi, there are currently four other permanent, part-time members. Their biographies are included in Annex A.</p> <p>The NSCA also provides for the appointment of temporary members who may be appointed to the Commission for a maximum of three years. However, temporary members may continue to serve past the three-year period to take part in the disposition of any matter in which they became engaged while holding office as members. There is currently a three-member panel that was established for Ontario Power Generation&#39;s proposed deep geologic repository for the disposal of low- and intermediate-level radioactive wastes. Their biographies are included in Annex B.</p> <p>The Commission is a court of record and makes decisions on the licensing of nuclear-related activities in Canada, establishes legally binding regulations, and sets regulatory policy direction on matters related to health, safety, security and environmental issues affecting the Canadian nuclear industry. The Commission has significant experience dealing with governance issues given its need to be, and be perceived to be, independent, fair and unbiased in its decision-making. The Commission holds public hearings for major licensing decisions during which the perspectives of Indigenous peoples, the public and stakeholders are welcomed and in some instances supported through participant funding.</p> <p>The Commission may delegate licensing and other decisions as appropriate to designated CNSC staff. When establishing regulatory policy, making licensing decisions and implementing programs, it takes into account the views, concerns and opinions of industry, interested members of the public, and Indigenous peoples.</p> <p>A Commission Secretariat plans the business of the Commission and gives technical and administrative support to the President and to the other Commission members. This involves related communications with all stakeholders, including government departments, licensees and the public, as well as Indigenous peoples, on Commission affairs. The Secretariat is also the official registrar in relation to Commission documentation and manages the hearing process.</p> <p>The Commission is authorized to appoint and employ professional, scientific, technical or other officers or employees it considers necessary for the purposes of its objects under the NSCA. The President of the Commission is also Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Commission with responsibility for supervising and directing the work of the Commission.</p> <p>The Commission is an independent agency of the Government of Canada, but is accountable in the following ways:</p> <ol className="list-lower-alpha">   <li><strong>Accountability to Parliament</strong>: The Commission reports to Parliament through the Minister of Natural Resources. It submits annual reports to Parliament, as well as the <cite>Departmental Plan and a Departmental Results Report</cite>. The President and CEO of the Commission appears before parliamentary committees to elaborate on matters related to the administration of the regulatory regime.</li>   <li><strong>Legal Accountability</strong>: Regulatory decisions by the Commission can be reviewed only by the Federal Court. As a federal agency, the Commission is subject to various laws (e.g., the <cite>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</cite>, the <cite>Official Languages Act</cite>, the <cite>Privacy Act</cite>, the <cite>Access to Information Act</cite> and the <cite>Financial Administration Act</cite>).</li> </ol> <h2 id="sec4">4. Legislative authority, regulatory philosophy, and scope of regulation the commission&#39;s legislative authority</h2> <h3>The Commission&#39;s legislative authority</h3> <h4><cite>Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA)</cite></h4> <p>The Commission was established in May 2000 when the NSCA came into force. This Act replaced the <cite>Atomic Energy Control Act</cite> that had been in place since 1946 without significant change and under which the Atomic Energy Control Board (the predecessor to the Commission) regulated the nuclear industry.</p> <p>The NSCA is supported by a set of regulations, as well as by a suite of regulatory documents that provide guidance on the Commission&#39;s expectations. International nuclear regulatory agreements and legally-binding conventions are also implemented by the Commission, especially in the areas of non-proliferation and safeguards. These obligations are sometimes incorporated into regulatory requirements through amendments to regulations.</p> <h3>Other nuclear related legislation</h3> <h4><cite>Nuclear Energy Act (NEA)</cite> (Minister of Natural Resources)</h4> <p>This Act sets out the Minister&#39;s powers with respect to authorizing the utilization of nuclear technology and research and development activities relating to it.</p> <h4><cite>Nuclear Fuel Waste Act (NFWA)</cite> (Minister of Natural Resources)</h4> <p>This legislation sets out the requirements for the owners of nuclear fuel waste to arrange for its permanent management and storage. Its provision led to the creation of the Nuclear Waste Management Organization (NWMO), a consortium of nuclear facility operators.</p> <h4><cite>Impact Assessment Act (IAA)</cite> (Minister of Environment and Climate Change)</h4> <p>Passed in 2019, this legislation replaced the <cite>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act</cite>, 2012 (CEAA 2012) and sets out the requirements for impact assessments of major projects, including nuclear projects. In accordance with provisions of the IAA, when the nature of a nuclear project requires that an impact assessment be carried out, the process will be led by the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada. The review panel for the assessment will include at least one member appointed from the CNSC but such member(s) must not constitute a majority of the panel.</p> <h4><cite>Nuclear Liability and Compensation Act (NLCA)</cite> (Minister of Natural Resources)</h4> <p>The NLCA came into force in 2017 and provides for a liability limit of $850&nbsp;million (increasing to $1&nbsp;billion on January&nbsp;1, 2020) in the event of a nuclear accident. The NLCA replaced the <cite>Nuclear Liability Act</cite> and modernized Canada&#39;s nuclear liability regime by clarifying and broadening the number of categories for which compensation may be sought and improving the procedures for delivering compensation. Natural Resources Canada administers the NLCA. The CNSC&#39;s role is to provide advice to the Governor in Council on the designation of nuclear facilities for the purpose of establishing liability insurance requirements.</p> <h3>Regulatory philosophy</h3> <p>The CNSC&#39;s regulatory program is based on two accountability principles:</p> <ul>   <li>Those persons and organizations that are subject to the NSCA and associated regulations are directly responsible for ensuring that the regulated activities in which they engage are managed in order to protect the health, safety, and security of Canadians and the environment; as well as ensuring that Canada implements its international nuclear obligations.</li>   <li>The CNSC is responsible to the public for regulating persons and organizations that are subject to the NSCA and associated regulations in order to assure that they are properly discharging their obligations. </li> </ul> <p>The CNSC uses a risk-informed approach to regulation that is focused on protecting the health, safety, and security of Canadians and the environment, as well as ensuring that Canada meets its international nuclear commitments on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.</p> <h3>Scope of nuclear regulation in Canada</h3> <p>The regulation of nuclear energy and nuclear substances is a federal jurisdiction by virtue of section&nbsp;71 of the NSCA, which declares nuclear works and undertakings to be for the general advantage of Canada. This derives from the potential health, safety and security concerns associated with the development and use of nuclear energy or nuclear substances which are largely extra-provincial and international in character and implications.</p> <p>The CNSC is the federal government agency responsible for regulating the development, production and use of nuclear energy and the production, possession and use of nuclear substances, prescribed equipment and prescribed information, in the areas outlined below. The authority to regulate is set out in the NSCA and the specific regulations under this Act.</p> <p>The NSCA establishes a licensing regime for all nuclear facilities and nuclear-related activities, requiring that any person who wishes to carry out prescribed activities have a licence from the Commission before doing so. Licences may include conditions that are specific to the proposed use or activity, including the requirement for financial guarantees.</p> <p>The scope of regulated activities is extensive and includes:</p> <ul>   <li>power reactors</li>   <li>non-power reactors</li>   <li>nuclear research and test facilities</li>   <li>uranium mines, mills, processing and fuel fabrication facilities</li>   <li>nuclear substance processing facilities</li>   <li>particle accelerators</li>   <li>waste management facilities</li>   <li>nuclear substances and radiation devices</li>   <li>irradiation equipment</li>   <li>packaging and transportation of nuclear substances</li>   <li>imports and exports of controlled nuclear materials, equipment, technology and information</li>   <li>exports of nuclear related dual-use materials, equipment and technology</li>   <li>cancer treatment (i.e., brachytherapy and teletherapy)</li>   <li>dosimetry service providers</li> </ul> <p>There are over 1,700 licensees in Canada who hold over 2,500 licences. Licensees&#39; compliance with their licences and any related conditions is verified by Commission staff through a range of compliance activities.</p> <p>The Commission has an extensive suite of regulatory enforcement measures available to enforce licensee compliance including increased regulatory scrutiny, orders, licence amendments, monetary penalties and prosecution for regulatory offences set out in the NSCA.</p> <h2 id="sec5">5. Priority initiatives and projects</h2> <p>The CNSC is looking for the Minister&#39;s support on the following files</p> <div className="module mrgn-bttm-lg"><p>Secret information removed.</p></div> <div className="module mrgn-bttm-lg"><p>Secret information removed.</p></div> <div className="module mrgn-bttm-lg"><p>Secret information removed.</p></div> <h3>Regulations</h3> <p>The CNSC is proposing updates to three regulations to better align with international standards, guidelines and best practices in radiation protection, safeguarding nuclear material, and controlling nuclear and nuclear-related material. The Commission has statutory authority to make regulations, with approval of the Governor in Council, and as such, the Minister&#39;s support is needed to enable the regulations to move through the Government of Canada regulation-making process. The three regulations will be presented to the Minister in two different packages – one for publication in the <cite>Canada Gazette</cite>, Part II and a second for pre-publication in the <cite>Canada Gazette</cite>, Part I.</p> <ol>   <li><strong><cite>Radiation Protection Regulations</cite></strong> amendments are proposed to reflect changes to international benchmarks and new radiation protection guidance that has been adopted worldwide. The proposed changes were pre-published in the <cite>Canada Gazette</cite>, Part I in 2019 and the feedback is being reviewed before work commences with the Department of Justice to finalize them. It is anticipated that the final regulations will be presented to the Commission for it to make the regulations in March 2020, after which the Minister&#39;s recommendation to the Governor in Council for publication in the <cite>Canada Gazette</cite>, Part II will be requested. A package seeking Ministerial recommendation will be submitted in April 2020.</li>   <li><strong><cite>Nuclear Non-proliferation Import and Export Control Regulations</cite></strong> amendments are proposed to modernize the regulations and align with current international guidelines, including harmonizing export control items with other nuclear supplier countries. The CNSC is targeting stakeholder feedback through pre-publication in the <cite>Canada Gazette</cite>, Part I in June 2020. A package for approval by the Minister will be submitted in March 2020.</li>   <li><strong><cite>General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations</cite></strong> amendments are proposed to ensure the continued effective reporting and monitoring of nuclear materials and activities in Canada. The amendments will align the regulations with commitments set out in international agreements, specifically, the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement and Additional Protocol. The CNSC is targeting stakeholder feedback through pre-publication in the <cite>Canada Gazette</cite>, Part I in June 2020, and these regulations will be submitted as part of the package with the Nuclear Non-proliferation Import and Export Control Regulations for the Minister&#39;s approval in March 2020.</li> </ol> <div className="module">   <p>The Minister should be aware of several nuclear projects in the public spotlight, including those undergoing a CNSC-led environmental assessment (EA) under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 (CEAA 2012) and a soon-to-be-released report from the International Atomic Energy Agency</p> </div> <h3>Three Environmental Assessments (EAs) for Canadian Nuclear Laboratories Waste Management Projects (Ontario and Manitoba)</h3> <ol>   <li><strong>Near Surface Disposal Facility</strong> (NSDF), Chalk River Laboratories, Deep River, ON
<ul>
<li>Proposal to build an engineered near-surface waste management facility to store low-level radioactive wastes.</li>
</ul>   </li>   <li><strong>Nuclear Power Demonstration</strong> (NPD) Closure Project, Rolphton, ON
<ul>
<li>Proposal for partial removal/partial in-situ grouting of decommissioned reactor and remediation of the site.</li>
</ul>   </li>   <li><strong>Decommissioning of Whiteshell Reactor #1</strong> (WR-1), Pinawa, MB
<ul>
<li>Proposal for partial removal/partial in-situ grouting of decommissioned reactor and remediation of the site.</li>
</ul>   </li> </ol> <p>Applications for these projects, which are being managed by Canadian Nuclear Laboratories (CNL) on behalf of Atomic Energy Canada Limited (AECL), were filed between April 1 and May 16, 2016. There have been considerable delays in the completion of Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) for each. Public hearings are expected in late-2020 and 2021 but will not commence until satisfactory EISs are submitted.</p> <p>Significant concerns have been expressed by Indigenous groups and environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in both Ontario and Quebec over the NSDF and its proximity to the Ottawa River. Indigenous groups and NGOs have also expressed significant concerns over the NPD and WR-1 projects, particularly around in-situ decommissioning, including their views that the approach does not align with international standards.</p> <p>In accordance with the IAA, these projects will all continue under the current CEAA 2012 process with the CNSC as the lead in the conduct of the EAs. This is in line with the Government&#39;s principle that no project will be required to restart from zero. The CNSC has significant experience with EAs and our EA processes are rigorous, including robust public participation and Indigenous consultation.</p> <h3>Two EAs for New Uranium Mining Projects (Saskatchewan)</h3> <ol>   <li><strong>Rook-1</strong> (NexGen Energy Ltd.), northern Saskatchewan
<ul>
<li>Proposal for underground mine to produce up to 14,000,000 kilograms (14,000 tonnes) of uranium annually for twenty-four years.</li>
</ul>   </li>   <li><strong>Wheeler River</strong> (Denison Mines Corporation), northern Saskatchewan
<ul>
<li>Proposal for in-situ recovery uranium mining and processing operation to produce up to 5,400,000 kilograms (5,400 tonnes) of uranium annually for twenty years.</li>
</ul>   </li> </ol> <p>EAs for these projects commenced on May 2 and 31, 2019, respectively. Uranium mining is a mature industry in northern Saskatchewan and existing licence holders are well aware of their obligations to protect the environment and engage with Indigenous peoples. However, the proponents for these two projects are new to northern Saskatchewan and how any potential impacts to rights and the environment will be addressed in the EA will require these proponents to understand their responsibilities.</p> <h3>Global First Power Micro Modular Reactor Project Application (Chalk River Laboratories)</h3> <p>A small modular reactor, which represents a significant innovation in Canada&#39;s nuclear industry, has been proposed at Chalk River Laboratories. Global First Power (GFP), supported by Ontario Power Generation (OPG), submitted an application in March 2019 to build a low-power demonstration SMR on the Chalk River Laboratories site. The CNSC-led EA under CEAA, 2012 commenced on July 15, 2019.</p> <p>This first-of-a-kind project, close to the Ottawa River, is garnering significant interest by the public, NGOs and Indigenous groups from both Ontario and Quebec. Recently, the Kebaowek First Nation made a request to the Minister of Environment and Climate Change that the project be subject to an Impact Assessment under the <cite>Impact Assessment Act</cite> and the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada&#39;s authority.</p> <p>This is the first of many SMR project proposals that the CNSC anticipates in the years ahead as Canada and many other countries look to SMRs as an important part of the fight against climate change while providing energy security.</p> <p>The CNSC has for several years offered an optional, pre-licensing vendor design review (VDR) service. These reviews do not represent the certification or pre-licensing approval of a design, but help vendors identify any potential fundamental barriers to licensing their designs in Canada. As of November 20, 2019, there are 12 SMR vendors  at various phases of the CNSC&#39;s VDR service.</p> <p>The CNSC has a flexible regulatory framework in place for the licensing and oversight of innovative nuclear technologies such as SMRs. However, the CNSC has been advocating recently for all nuclear regulators to take a critical look at their frameworks to ensure they are appropriate to allow for innovation and do not present any unnecessary barriers, while at all times remaining focused on safety.</p> <p>In August 2019, the CNSC and the American nuclear regulator, the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, signed a memorandum of cooperation to further streamline and improve our regulation of SMRs. Through this collaboration, we have committed to explore ways to minimize the duplication of effort and make regulatory reviews more efficient, which will result in more predictable outcomes and increased safety. This includes sharing regulatory insights from our respective pre-licensing reviews, which should result in no or minimal impediments during the licensing process.</p> <p>Through this joint Canadian – American leadership, we will seek convergence in the regulatory and licensing reviews of SMRs. The objective in the long run is to seek harmonization in requirements and practices and facilitate the import and export of SMR technologies. This will be especially useful for embarking nuclear countries, or countries considering nuclear, which are often challenged by the resources and infrastructure required for the effective and safe review, licensing and regulation of nuclear technologies.</p> <h3>Deep Geological Repositories for Used Nuclear Fuel and Radioactive Wastes</h3> <h4>Deep Geologic Repository (DGR) for Low- and Intermediate-Level Waste (Kincardine, Ontario)</h4> <p>This project, proposed by Ontario Power Generation (OPG) in 2005, would see the construction of a Deep Geologic Repository (DGR) on the Bruce Nuclear Generating Site on the eastern shore of Lake Huron. It would be used for the disposal of low- and intermediate-level operational and refurbishment radioactive wastes from OPG-owned nuclear generating stations at the Bruce, Pickering and Darlington sites in Ontario.</p> <p>The EA, which began under the <cite>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act</cite>, but was then transferred under CEAA, 2012, began in January 2006 and was considered by a Joint Review Panel in 2013 and 2014 during 33 days of public hearings. The final EA report with recommendations was submitted to the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change (ECC) in 2015. The Minister requested additional information from OPG, including a process of reconciling issues of a local Indigenous community, the Saugeen Ojibway Nation (SON).</p> <p>OPG is working closely with the SON and the additional information for the Minister of ECC is expected in 2020. If the additional information satisfies the Minister of ECC and the Minister issues a positive decision, the Panel will reconvene under the NSCA to consider licensing to prepare the site for eventual construction.</p> <p>The EA generated significant public interest and concerns, including in the United States, about potential impacts to the environment and Indigenous rights and interests, which are expected to persist if a positive EA decision is issued.</p> <h4>Deep Geologic Repository for Used Nuclear Fuel</h4> <p>The CNSC expects an application from the Nuclear Waste Management Organization (NWMO) for a deep geologic repository for Canada&#39;s used nuclear fuel in 2023 at the earliest.</p> <p>In advance of that anticipated application, the CNSC and the NWMO have a service arrangement in place that enables the CNSC to engage with potential host communities. Through this engagement, the CNSC provides factual and unbiased information about how the CNSC regulates Canada&#39;s nuclear sector, including DGRs.</p> <p>The CNSC expects that the five remaining potential host communities will be narrowed down to two by the end of 2019.</p> <h3>Darlington Nuclear Generating Station Refurbishment Project (Ontario)</h3> <p>In October 2016, Ontario Power Generation began a $12.8 billion project to refurbish and extend for 30 years the lives of the four reactors at the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station in the Municipality of Clarington on the western shore of Lake Ontario. The refurbishment project began with Unit 2 in October 2016 and is expected to be completed in June 2020. Unit 3 will be refurbished next, with an estimated start date of February 2020 and completion date of June 2023. Unit 1 is scheduled to begin in July 2021 and be completed in September 2024 and Unit 4 is expected to begin in January 2023 and be completed in February 2026.</p> <p>The CNSC is maintaining regulatory oversight throughout the project and no undue risks to health, safety or the environment and no technical challenges have been observed to date. </p> <h3>Bruce Nuclear Generating Station Refurbishment (Major Component Replacement) Project (Ontario)</h3> <p>In 2020, Bruce Power will begin a $13 billion project to refurbish and extend for 30 years the lives of six of the eight reactors at the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station in Kincardine on the eastern shore of Lake Huron. The project will begin with Unit 6 in 2020, which is scheduled to be completed in 2023. Unit 3 will follow, beginning in 2023 and be completed in 2026. Unit 4 will begin in 2025 and be completed in 2027. Unit 5 will begin in 2026 and be completed in 2029. Unit 7 will begin in 2028 and be completed in 2031. Unit 8 will begin in 2030 and be completed in 2033. Units 1 and 2 were previously refurbished and resumed operation in 2012 for an expected 30 years.</p> <p>The CNSC will maintain regulatory oversight throughout the project.</p> <h3>International Atomic Energy Agency Peer Reviews</h3> <h4>Emergency Preparedness Review Service</h4> <p>In June 2019, Canada hosted an Emergency Preparedness Review (EPREV) mission. EPREV is a service offered by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), whereby a team of international experts appraises a Member State&#39;s level of emergency preparedness for nuclear and radiological emergencies. Canada was the first G7 nation to host an EPREV.</p> <p>The mission identified several strengths in Canada&#39;s emergency preparedness and response (EPR) framework. These included Canada&#39;s well-developed and mature EPR system in place across all levels of government and the government&#39;s streamlined approach for the timely processing of liability claims relating to nuclear or radiological emergencies.</p> <p>The mission also made several suggestions to strengthen EPR including the development of detailed arrangements for formally terminating a nuclear emergency.</p> <p>The Government of Canada is developing an action plan to address the recommendations and suggestions in the report and plans to make the report public upon completion of the action plan, which is anticipated in early 2020. The Government also intends to host a follow-up EPREV mission in approximately 2 – 4 years.</p> <h4>Integrated Regulatory Review Service</h4> <p>In September 2019, Canada hosted an Integrated Regulatory Review Service (IRRS) mission to review elements of the CNSC&#39;s regulatory framework for safety and its core regulatory processes. IRRS is a service offered by the IAEA whereby a country&#39;s regulatory framework and practices are compared with international standards and equivalent good practices elsewhere in the world.</p> <p>The mission found that Canada has a comprehensive framework for nuclear and radiation safety covering current facilities and activities. It also found that the CNSC strives to continuously upgrade its regulatory framework to address new challenges in relation to upcoming technologies, such as small modular reactors. Several good practices were identified, including that the CNSC is highly transparent about its regulatory activities and decisions. Several recommendations and suggestions were also made to enhance Canada&#39;s regulatory framework.</p> <p>The mission reviewed Canada&#39;s Radioactive Waste Policy Framework (RWPF), which is the responsibility of NRCan, as part of its review. The RWPF and radioactive waste in Canada have been concerns for some groups in recent years. Critics have filed petitions over the adequacy of Canada&#39;s radioactive waste policy with Parliamentarians and the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development (CESD).</p> <p>After reviewing the RWPF, the mission recommended that the Government enhance the policy and strategy for radioactive waste management, and ensure that its principles are formalized and include decommissioning strategies. This recommendation may impact the waste projects undergoing CNSC-led EAs.</p> <p>The IRRS&#39;s full report from the mission will be finalized and made public by December 2019, along with an Action Plan that includes Canada&#39;s commitments to addressing the suggestions and recommendations made in the report.</p> <h2 id="anxA">Annex A: Members of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission</h2> <p>The <cite>Nuclear Safety and Control Act</cite> provides for the appointment of not more than seven permanent Commission members by Order in Council and of temporary members.

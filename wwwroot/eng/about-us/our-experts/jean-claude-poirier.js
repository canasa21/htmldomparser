He has also been instrumental in developing the Conduct of Inspection corporate process and the Enforcement Strategy, and he&#39;s currently leading the development of the CNSC&#39;s corporate position on investigations. This includes working with training experts to develop and deliver Inspector Training and Qualification Program courses.</p>
<p>“My entire career has revolved around increasing the quality of our compliance and enforcement regime to better and more effectively serve and protect Canadians,” says JC.</p>
<p>With his vast expertise, he has become a subject-matter expert in his field and he has been actively involved in and has chaired the Community of Federal Regulators&#39; AMPs Working Group for the past 9 years.</p>

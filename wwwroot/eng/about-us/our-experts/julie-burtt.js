<h2>Roles and responsibilities </h2>
<p>Julie J. Burtt is a radiation and health sciences officer at  the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC). Ms.&nbsp;Burtt has 15 years of  experience in the field of radiation biology. She is primarily responsible for  assessing the risks of exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation. She has  extensive experience in risk communication and human health risk assessment,  and frequently provides expert scientific and technical information to the CNSC  Commission, the public, Indigenous groups and other stakeholders, as well as to  colleagues in Canada and abroad.</p>  	<p>Ms. Burtt has been an advisor with the Canadian delegation  to the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation  (UNSCEAR) for 2019 and 2020. In addition, she is a member of the Nuclear Energy  Agency&rsquo;s Expert Group on Non-Radiological Public Health Aspects of Radiation  Emergency Planning and Response (EGNR). Ms. Burtt is also a member of the  COHERE Scientific Committee.</p>

<p>Radiation and Health Sciences Specialist, Health Sciences and Environmental Compliance Division, CNSC</p>
<h2>Expertise</h2>
<p>Epidemiology, Radiation Protection, Risk Assessment, Risk  Communication, Public Health, Disease Prevention, Health Promotion</p>
<h2>Preferred language</h2>
<p>English</p>
<h2>Roles and responsibilities </h2>
<p>Dr. Rachel Lane is a radiation and health sciences  specialist with the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC). She has over 25  years of experience as an epidemiologist, assessing the health effects of  radiation and other occupational, environmental and behavioural risk factors.  Her experience includes risk communication, public health, disease  surveillance, risk assessment, and health economics. Her current areas of  interest are assessing the health effects of low levels of radiation exposure  and the use of varied approaches to communicate objective scientific  information effectively. She is especially interested in working with  Indigenous groups and currently co-chairs a working group to incorporate  Indigenous knowledge into CNSC processes.</p>
<p> As an adjunct professor at Carleton University&rsquo;s Department  of Health Sciences since 2017, she has been on the graduate advisory committee  of PhD candidates and has co-supervised undergraduate students on fourth-year  research projects. She is currently co-leading a CNSC WISTEM&ndash;Carleton pilot  project to support women in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math)  research. She has been a mentor to many students, interns and new graduates, as  well as to her peers, especially her CNSC Health Sciences team, which consists  of young female researchers.</p>
<p> Dr. Lane has been an advisor with the Canadian delegation to  the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation  (UNSCEAR) from 2006 to 2015, in 2019 and in 2020. She was a lead writer of two  expert working groups for the UNSCEAR 2013 Report on levels and effects of  radiation exposures due to the nuclear accident after the 2011 great east-Japan  earthquake and tsunami. She also led the UNSCEAR 2016 Report, Annex C,  Biological Effects of Selected Internal Emitters &ndash; Tritium (2011&ndash;2012). Currently,  she is a member of the Cancer Epidemiology Expert Group (CEEG) for the UNSCEAR  Report on cancer epidemiology.</p>
<h2>Current research and/or projects</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Canadian Uranium Workers Study (CANUWS)  includes 80,000 Canadian uranium workers, with mortality (1945&ndash;2017) and cancer  incidence (1969&ndash;2017) follow-up. The large epidemiological study will assess  the radon / lung cancer relationship of different types of uranium workers,  focusing on low radon exposures and low exposure rates.</li>
<li>International Pooled Analysis of Uranium Workers  (iPAUW) harmonizes 16 cohorts of 100,000 uranium processing workers and  calculates organ doses from uranium bioassay, radon decay products, and  external ionizing radiation exposures. The large statistical power of the  analysis of pooled data will provide substantially greater ability to describe  radon-, gamma- and long-lived radionuclide-associated risks for these workers.</li>
<li>The Mortality (1945&ndash;2017) and Cancer Incidence  (1969&ndash;2017) Update of the National Dose Registry (NDR) provides updated follow-up  of 950,000 Canadian workers exposed to occupational ionizing radiation. A  validation exercise will begin in 2020&ndash;2021. Many epidemiological risk  assessment projects can be undertaken thereafter.</li>
<li>Canadian Fluoroscopy Cohort Study (CFCS) extends  mortality (1950&ndash;present) and cancer incidence (1969&ndash;present) follow-up of  64,000 Canadian tuberculous patients exposed to repeated diagnostic imaging  fluoroscopies between 1930&ndash;1952, with a new Fluoroscopy X-Ray Organ-Specific  (FLUXOR) Dosimetry System to assess the causal association between low dose  X-ray radiation exposures protracted over time and cancer.</li>
<li>Lung Cancer Histology among the Eldorado Cohort  of Uranium Miners examines radiation-related risks for incident lung cancer,  with special attention on three main histological subtypes (squamous cell,  small cell and adenocarcinoma), separately and together for radon progeny  internal exposures and &gamma;-ray external exposures.</li>
<li>Newfoundland Fluorspar Miners&rsquo; Cohort Study  provides important insights on associations between occupational exposure to  radon and lung cancer and cardiovascular mortality. This study provides updated  analyses of 2,121 miners with extended mortality and cancer incidence follow-up  through to 2016. This increased length of follow-up had the benefit of  identifying a greater number of deaths and incidence cancer, therefore  increasing the precision of risk estimates.</li>

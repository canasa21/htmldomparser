<p>The CNSC is focused on helping its employees develop their careers and take advantage of opportunities to learn and grow as world-class professionals. A number of unique benefits are offered and these are designed to support balance and productivity:</p>
<h2> Banked Time</h2>
<p>The CNSC offers you the opportunity to bank productive work time, with the approval of your manager. If you work in excess of your normal hours of work—whether on a normal work day, a day of rest, or a designated holiday—you can accumulate your extra hours and take this time off at a later date.</p>
<h2> Bilingual Bonus</h2>
<p>The CNSC has made the independent decision to offer its employees a bilingualism bonus because it recognizes the importance bilingualism plays in maintaining employees&#39; mobility within the greater Public Service. Our method of calculating the bonus (the amount increases with the level attained) directly rewards employees' efforts to improve their language skills.</p>
<p>The bilingualism bonus consists of annual payment on each pay cheque, up to $1,200 annually. If you are eligible, you can receive the bilingualism bonus for any month in which you receive a minimum of 10 days pay in a position where the bilingualism bonus applies. If you&#39;re a part-time employee, you can receive the bonus prorated to the normal hours an employee is expected to work.</p>
<h2> Awards and Recognition</h2>
<p>Our awards and recognition practices are designed to foster excellence and pride in your work and to encourage your individual and collective commitment to our organization&#39;s goals and objectives.</p>
<h2> Learning</h2>
<p>The CNSC is committed to supporting you in developing your skills and knowledge because this enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations and builds a professional, competent, versatile, and motivated workforce.</p>
<h2> Career Opportunities at the CNSC</h2>
<p>The CNSC looks to its exceptional staff when career opportunities come up.</p>

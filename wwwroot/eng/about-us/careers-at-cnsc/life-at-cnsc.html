<p>We believe that there's more to life than a career, no matter
how satisfying that career is. Balanced, rewarded and recognized
employees are happier and more productive, which creates a work
environment that they can enjoy.</p>
<p>We asked current employees what they love about the CNSC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Great work–life balance</li>
<li>Excellent compensation and benefits</li>
<li>Opportunities for learning, movement and advancement</li>
<li>Ability to make a difference in a small organization</li>
<li>Open and transparent management practices</li>
<li>Fun social events</li>
<li>Fantastic colleagues</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the things that are important to our employees. We
think that they may be important to you, too.</p>

<p>Our compensation and benefits package is one of the most
competitive in the public service – and it's not only about the
money.</p>

<h3>Work–life balance</h3>
<p>CNSC employees do important and challenging work, but they also
have time to enjoy their personal lives. We offer a variety of
flexible work arrangements such as flexible working hours, working
from home, leave with income averaging, and the ability to
accumulate and use banked time.</p>
<p>We also hold social activities throughout the year to bring fun
into the workplace, and to get to know our colleagues and
management better. You can expect holiday parties, team-building
activities, and the opportunity to participate in a variety of
summer and winter activities. The majority of our events donate
proceeds to the Government of Canada Workplace Charitable Campaign
– so you can have fun, and feel good about it too!</p>
<h2 id="sec2">Learning</h2>
<div class="col-md-3 pull-right">
<div class="module-poster"><img src="./images/career-learning.jpg"
alt="" />
<p>Continuous learning is encouraged and supported because we
invest in our employees.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>Lifelong learning</h3>
<p>We believe that learning should be a career-long process. We see
it as a partnership: employees are responsible for their own
development, managers enable career development, and the
organization offers excellent learning opportunities. This
partnership makes our operations more effective, and our workforce
more qualified and agile.</p>
<p>All of our employees work with their manager to complete an
Individual Learning Plan (ILP), which ensures that continuous
learning and development is present at all stages of their
careers.</p>
<h3>Our program</h3>
<p>Our learning program spans the full range of learning activities
– not just in-class sessions. First and foremost, we prioritize
on-the-job learning. Employees are encouraged to learn in their
current role, diversify their work experience with assignments or
micro-missions within the CNSC, or take advantage of interchange
opportunities. We are also strong believers in learning through
self-directed research, networking and coaching.</p>

<h2>How to prepare for an assessment</h2>
<p>The assessment is a crucial part of the selection process. It’s
your opportunity to convince the hiring manager that you have what
it takes. This is your opportunity to shine and to demonstrate the
added value that you will bring to the team.</p>
<p>This section provides helpful tips to prepare for any assessment
and introduces the <a href=
"/eng/about-us/careers-at-cnsc/key-behavioral-competencies.cfm">CNSC
Key Behavioural Competencies</a> (KBCs) that successful candidates
must demonstrate.</p>
<p>Here are some tips that will set you up for success:</p>

assessed.</li>
<li>Think of past accomplishments that could be used to illustrate
your readiness for this job.</li>
<li>Visit the CNSC’s website and familiarize yourself with key CNSC
documents (e.g., Departmental Plan, governance and structure) in
the context of the job you are seeking.</li>
<li>Talk to people who are knowledgeable about the position, if
possible.</li>
<li>Anticipate potential questions and prepare for the assessment
based on the <a href="key-behavioral-competencies.cfm">CNSC Key

<h3>The interview</h3>
<ul>
<li>If given preparation time, take notes; this will help you
structure your responses.</li>
<li>Listen attentively to questions and ask for clarification if
you need to.</li>
<li>Be positive and enthusiastic while still being yourself.</li>
<li>At the end, don’t hesitate to ask questions. Be curious!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info module-simplify">
<h3>The written test</h3>
<ul>
<li>Read the instructions carefully.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Before you start writing, skim through the entire package and
allocate timeframes for answering questions. Highlight key
words.</li>
<li>Jot down key words to incorporate into your answer; this will
help you to organize your ideas.</li>
<li>Start with the questions that are the easiest for you – don’t
lose track of time.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>After the Assessment</h2>
<p>Once the assessment is complete, the board members will
reconvene to evaluate all candidates. The hiring manager may check
references to validate and complement the competencies being
assessed.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info module-simplify">
<p><strong>TIP:</strong> If you are asked to provide references, be
sure to contact your references beforehand so they will be prepared
to speak about your experience!</p>
</div>
<p>Among all qualified candidates, the hiring manager determines
the right fit for the position based on current and anticipated
needs.&nbsp; The name of other qualified candidates is kept for
possible consideration to fill similar positions.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info module-simplify">
<h3>Final steps before the letter of offer</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> Effective July 2015, the Government
of Canada requires that all employees obtaining, renewing or
upgrading a security clearfixance be fingerprinted. Booking an
appointment in a timely manner will assist Security Services in
expediting your clearfixance update (if required).</li>
<li><strong>Official languages:</strong> If the position is
bilingual, you may have to be tested if you have no valid second
language evaluation (SLE) results, if your SLE results are expired
or if the position requires a higher level of proficiency. (Note:
SLE results are valid for five years.)</li>
<li><strong>Medical:</strong> Some positions at the CNSC require a
medical examination due to the nature of the work and to ensure the
safety of all workers. The HR assistant will provide you with
details in order to schedule your appointment with a
physician.</li>
</ul>

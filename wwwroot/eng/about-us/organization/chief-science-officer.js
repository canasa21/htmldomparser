</div>  	<p>At the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC), science and evidence-based information are the foundation of regulatory decision-making and recommendations to the <a href="/eng/the-commission/">Commission</a>. The recent appointment of Peter Elder as Chief Science Officer (CSO) of the CNSC builds on this base</p>
<p>Scientific expertise and activities are strong at the CNSC in a range of areas such as  geophysics, engineering, nuclear physics, biology, radiology and environmental  risk management. CNSC staff use science as a source of invaluable data  for developing regulatory documents, conducting environmental and radiological  assessments and monitoring, and carrying out licensing reviews. This scientific knowledge also  supports the organization's  mandate to disseminate objective scientific, technical and regulatory  information to the public. </p>
<p>As CSO, Peter Elder has a mandate to  lead the CNSC's technical services and provide advice in support of the  organization's regulatory activities. He is accountable for ensuring that the  appropriate scientific advice informs the CNSC's regulatory decision making and  that the best expertise is made available.Â  </p>
<p>The CSO's vision is to make the role of science more explicit and  visible at the CNSC and ensure that staff explain to the Commission and to the  public how science is used in their regulatory recommendations. As part of this  vision, he actively encourages CNSC staff to speak freely about their work.</p>
<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Peter Elder brings a wealth of experience to this position. During his 20-year career  at the CNSC, he has held a variety of leadership roles across the nuclear fuel  cycle. He has also served as a nuclear counsellor at the Permanent Mission to  the International Organizations in Vienna. In this role, he advised the  Canadian government on International Atomic Energy Agency activities in nuclear  safety and security, emergency management and technical cooperation. </p>
<p>Before joining the CNSC, Peter Elder worked for Atomic Energy Canada  Limited as a section head and research scientist in the area of  high-temperature fuel behaviour and fission product release. He co-authored a  number of scientific papers during this period on fuel behaviour under accident  conditions, and was involved in several international collaborations in this  area. He completed a master's degree in materials engineering from Queen's  University after receiving his undergraduate degree in engineering science  (physics option) from the University of Toronto.</p>
<h2>Science and research at work  </h2>
<p>The CNSC is committed to scientific integrity in its  regulatory and nuclear safety environment. </p>
<p>The CSO plays a key role in leading scientific work at the CNSC and the  organization's participation in scientific research in collaboration with  national and international institutions. Read more about the CNSC's scientific  endeavours:</p>

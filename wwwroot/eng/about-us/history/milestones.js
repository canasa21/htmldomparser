<p>With the coming into force of the<a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/n-28.3/"><em> Nuclear Safety and Control Act</em></a> on May 31, 2000, the newly created Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) was empowered to carry out its <a href="/eng/about-us/our-mission">mission</a> as Canada&rsquo;s nuclear regulator. The CNSC continues the work of the Atomic Energy Control Board and the regulatory regime guided by the <em>Atomic Energy Control Act</em>.</p>
<p>The following is a selection of activities and events in the first 20 years of the CNSC&rsquo;s history.</p>  <h2 id="2020">2020</h2>  <div className="col-md-3 ">  <img src="/images/20th-anniversary/web_20milestones_2020.png" alt=""/>	  </div>  <div className="col-md-6 ">
<p className="mrgn-tp-0">The CNSC is selected as one of the <a href="https://www.canadastop100.com/ottawa/">National Capital Region&rsquo;s Top 25 Employers</a>. The CNSC is recognized for prioritizing health and wellness, offering retirement planning assistance and contributions, and celebrating the life achievements of its employees.<br/>
<br/>
On February 25, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announces that CNSC President Rumina Velshi has been appointed as the new Chair of its Commission on Safety Standards (CSS) for a four-year period. The IAEA&rsquo;s CSS is a standing body responsible for establishing standards relevant to nuclear, radiation, transport and waste safety, and emergency preparedness and response.<br/>
<br/>
In February, the IAEA releases a <a href="https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/documents/review-missions/irrs_canada_2019_final_report.pdf">report</a> assessing Canada&rsquo;s framework for nuclear safety following an <a href="https://www.iaea.org/services/review-missions/integrated-regulatory-review-service-irrs">Integrated Regulatory Review Service</a> (IRRS) mission. The CNSC requested the mission, which took place in September 2019, to benchmark its regulatory framework against international standards and best practices. The results confirm that the CNSC has a strong and effective regulatory framework and demonstrated leadership in multiple areas. The CNSC <a href="/eng/resources/international-cooperation/irrs/canada-response-irrs-2019#intro">responds</a> to the report when it is published.</p>
<p>In March, the CNSC responds to how it will operate and continue to provide regulatory oversight of Canada&rsquo;s nuclear sector during the <a href="/eng/resources/emergency-management-and-safety/pandemic-preparedness">COVID-19 pandemic</a>.</p>  </div>	  <div className="clear"></div>	  <h2 id="2019">2019</h2>  <div className="col-md-3 ">  <img src="/images/20th-anniversary/web_20milestones_2019-EN.png" alt=""/>  </div>  <div className="col-md-6 ">  <p className="mrgn-tp-0">In February, the CNSC concludes the Phase-1 vendor design review (VDR) of the micro modular reactor by Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation (USNC). The VDR considers that overall, USNC has demonstrated an understanding of CNSC regulatory requirements and expectations. The VDR notes that USNC will need to provide additional information on management system processes if it proceeds to a Phase-2 VDR. </p>  <p>In February, CNSC President and CEO <a href="/eng/resources/presentations/president-house-standing-committee-natural-resources">Rumina Velshi</a> appears before the House of Commons Standing Committee on Natural Resources, which is studying international best practices for engaging with Indigenous communities regarding major energy projects.</p>  <p>In March, the CNSC receives an application from Global First Power for a licence to prepare a site for a small modular reactor on Atomic Energy of Canada Limited&rsquo;s (AECL) property at the Chalk River Laboratories location. The CNSC licensing process begins with a sufficiency review of the application.</p>  <p>In August, the CNSC and the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (U.S. NRC) sign a Memorandum of Cooperation aimed at enhancing technical reviews of advanced reactor and small modular reactor technologies. In her remarks during the signing ceremony, CNSC Rumina Velshi stated: &ldquo;Globally, interest and advances in small modular reactor and advanced reactors are growing rapidly. The CNSC and U.S. NRC are working together as regulatory leaders to ensure the development and deployment of these innovative technologies are done safely and efficiently.&rdquo;</p>  <p>In October, the CNSC leads the <a href="https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/19/01/cn-265-report.pdf">International Symposium on Communicating Nuclear and Radiological Emergencies to the Public</a> hosted by the International Atomic Energy Agency.

The purpose of the study Radiation and Incidence of Cancer Around Ontario Nuclear Power Plants from 1990 to 2008 (the &quot;<a href="/eng/resources/research/technical-papers-and-articles/2013/2013-radiation-exposure">RADICON</a>&quot; study) is to determine the radiation doses to members of the public living within 25 km of the Pickering, Darlington and Bruce NPPs and compare cancer cases among these people with those among the general population of Ontario from 1990 to 2008. The study is conducted using data from the Canadian and Ontario Cancer Registries and the Census of Canada. The study concludes that public radiation doses resulting from the operation of the NPPs are 100 to 1,000 times lower than natural background radiation, and there is no evidence of childhood leukemia clusters around the three Ontario NPPs.</p>  <p>In mid-2014, Exercise Unified Response is carried out at the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station and involves all levels of government, including the utility operator. This three-day exercise tests different aspects of emergency preparedness and response. With more than 50 organizations involved, this is the first national, multi-jurisdictional, nuclear emergency response exercise conducted since 1999.</p>	  </div>  <div className="clear"></div>  <h2 id="2013">2013</h2>  <div className="col-md-3 ">  <img src="/images/20th-anniversary/web_20milestones_2013.png" alt=""/>  </div>  <div className="col-md-6 ">  <p className="mrgn-tp-0">In mid-2013, the CNSC introduces administrative monetary penalties (AMPs). AMPs are imposed by the regulator, without court involvement, for the violation of a regulatory requirement. They can be assessed to any individual or corporation subject to the <em><a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-28.3/index.html">Nuclear Safety and Control Act</a></em>. AMPs are a new tool in the CNSC&#39;s compliance verification and enforcement toolkit that gives the CNSC a broader range of options for responding to non-compliance.<br/>
<br/>
During 2013&ndash;14, as part of the continued examination of safety measures following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011, the CNSC publishes seven regulatory documents that clarify requirements in the areas of accident management, aging management, security, and compliance and enforcement. Three of these <a href="/eng/act-and-regulations/regulatory-documents/index#R20 ">publications</a> enhance CNSC requirements and guidance in the area of nuclear security: REGDOC-2.12.1, <em>High-Security Sites: Nuclear Response Force; REGDOC-2.12.2, Site Access Security Clearance</em>; and REGDOC-2.12.3, <em>Security of Nuclear Substances: Sealed Sources</em>.</p>  </div>

The objective is to ensure that information about the health, safety and security of persons and the environment and other issues associated with the lifecycle of a nuclear facility are effectively communicated to the public. These new regulatory requirements put the onus on licensees to proactively inform their public and stakeholders of their facilities&rsquo; activities, as well as any event or incident that occurs.</p>	  </div>  <div className="clear"></div>  <h2 id="2011">2011</h2>  <div className="col-md-3 ">  <img src="/images/20th-anniversary/web_20milestones_2011.png" alt=""/>  </div>  <div className="col-md-6 ">  <p className="mrgn-tp-0">In February, the CNSC launches the <a href="/eng/the-commission/participant-funding-program/index">Participant Funding Program</a> (PFP). The PFP provides members of the public, Indigenous groups and stakeholders with opportunities to request funding in support of their participation in the CNSC&rsquo;s regulatory decision-making process. It is available to those whose proposed activities are related to aspects of environmental assessments and/or a licensing action for major nuclear facilities (e.g., uranium mines, nuclear power plants or nuclear waste facilities). Funding may also be available for CNSC proceedings that are of significant interest to the public or to Indigenous groups.</p>  	<p>On March 11, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake strikes off the coast of Japan and causes a large tsunami that causes the loss of thousands of lives and half a million homes. It also causes an accident at TEPCO&#39;s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Following this event, the CNSC draws on its staff&rsquo;s scientific, technical and communications expertise to report on a daily basis to Canadians on the situation, on different aspects of radiation and on the safety of Canada&rsquo;s nuclear power plants (NPPs). The CNSC also requests that all NPP operators in Canada review the initial <a href="/eng/resources/publications/reports/action-plan-fukushima/index">lessons learned</a> from the earthquake and re-examine NPP safety cases. Specialists from Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. and the CNSC also join the International Atomic Energy Agency&rsquo;s Fukushima Accident Coordination Team. In addition, the CNSC establishes a four-year action plan to ensure that the lessons learned from the Fukushima accident are <a href="/eng/resources/fukushima/">applied</a> in Canada to enhance the safety of our nuclear facilities.</p>  <p>In May, the newly updated CNSC laboratory begins operation after $3 million in funding the CNSC receives in 2009 is used to renovate and refit existing vacant laboratory space at the Natural Resources Canada Limebank Road site in Ottawa. The modernized laboratory substantially enhances the CNSC&rsquo;s capacity for verifying licensee compliance programs, such as radiation protection, environmental protection, safeguards and emergency preparedness. A more rigorous calibration program for radiation detection instruments means CNSC inspectors are better equipped. Ultimately, the new laboratory means enhanced protection for nuclear energy workers, the public and the environment.</p>  </div>  	<div className="clear"></div>  <h2 id="2010">2010</h2>  <div className="col-md-3 ">  <img src="/images/20th-anniversary/web_20milestones_2010.png" alt=""/>  </div>  <div className="col-md-6 ">  	<p className="mrgn-tp-0">In September, the CNSC launches the CNSC 101 program, which seeks to improve the public&rsquo;s understanding of Canada&rsquo;s nuclear regulatory regime. It delivers information sessions to diverse audiences in select locations. Participants have an opportunity to learn and ask questions about the CNSC&rsquo;s role as Canada&rsquo;s nuclear regulator.</p>
<p>The CNSC holds a public hearing on Bruce Power&rsquo;s application to package and transport 16 steam generators through the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway to Sweden for recycling. Although initially non-radioactive, the bus-sized steam generators became contaminated on the inside by low levels of radioactivity during their service life. Through the licensed Swedish facility, the generators would be recycled after 90% of the metal is decontaminated and can be sold as scrap, leaving 10% of the original volume to be returned to the licensee for storage. The CNSC conducts a thorough environmental review under the <em>Nuclear Safety and Control Act</em> and concludes that the shipment poses a low risk. However, in light of public concern about the potential impact on health and the environment, the CNSC decides to hold a public hearing to allow the public to be heard by the Commission Tribunal and to facilitate the presentation of accurate information about the health and safety risks of the proposed shipment. A total of 77 intervenors take part in the <a href="http://nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/the-commission/hearings/documents_browse/results?dt=28-Sep-2010&yr=2010">hearing</a>.</p>  	</div>  <div className="clear"></div>  <h2 id="2009">2009</h2>  <div className="col-md-3 ">  <img src="/images/20th-anniversary/web_20milestones_2009.png" alt=""/>  </div>  <div className="col-md-6 ">  <p className="mrgn-tp-0">In January, the CNSC develops its Harmonized Plan of Improvement Initiatives. This plan responds to lessons learned from the Chalk River NRU reactor shutdown in 2007 and other relevant audit findings, and harmonizes improvement initiatives, bringing them under a single umbrella. </p>  <p>In May, the Treasury Board announces $250 million over two years to upgrade federal laboratories across the country. As part of the CNSC-related funding, a sum of $2 million is set aside in 2009&ndash;10 with an additional $1 million in 2010&ndash;11 to renovate and refit existing vacant laboratory space at the Natural Resources Canada Limebank Road site in Ottawa. The CNSC Lab was established in 1978 as an independent lab to validate the quality of measurements of levels of radiation taken by licensees and to calibrate instruments that CNSC inspectors use to detect contamination.</p>  <p>In May, the CNSC initiates an <a href="https://www.iaea.org/services/review-missions/integrated-regulatory-review-service-irrs">Integrated Regulatory Review Service</a> (IRRS) mission, a service offered by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The purpose of an IRRS mission is to compare the regulatory practices of a country with international standards and equivalent good practices elsewhere in the world. IRRS peer reviews are opportunities for both regulators and peer reviewers to learn about different approaches to the organization and practices of national regulatory bodies. The 2009 IRRS mission at the CNSC confirms the effectiveness of Canada&rsquo;s nuclear regulatory framework.</p>	  </div>  <div className="clear"></div>  <h2 id="2008">2008</h2>  <div className="col-md-3 ">  <img src="/images/20th-anniversary/web_20milestones_2008.png" alt=""/>  </div>  <div className="col-md-6 ">  	<p className="mrgn-tp-0">In January, Dr. Michael Binder is appointed President.</p>  	<p>In April, the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-28.3/index.html"><em>Nuclear Safety and Control Act</em></a> is amended to correct regulatory deficiencies and inconsistencies, increase the protection of workers, the public and the environment, and  adopt the latest international standards for exemption values and clearance levels. </p>

<h2 id="Prince">Alan T. Prince (1975&ndash;1978)</h2>	  <div className="col-md-2 ">  <img src="/images/20th-anniversary/web_presidents_Prince.png" alt="Alan T. Prince"/>  </div>  <div className="col-md-4 ">
<p className="mrgn-tp-0">Dr. Alan T. Prince was President of the AECB from 1975 to 1978. </p>
<p>Alan Prince received a bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s degree in arts from the University of Toronto and was awarded the Coleman Gold Medal in Geology for his expertise in this field of study. He completed his doctoral studies at the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>Following his studies, Prince worked at the National Research Council in Ottawa and at various federal agencies in roles of increasing responsibility, before joining the AECB in 1975. </p>
<p>During his time as President, Prince focused on making communication with Canadians a priority, which continues to this day. He also placed importance on the nuclear sector&#39;s responsibility to be accountable for its decisions. Consequently,&nbsp;the <em>Nuclear Liability Act</em>&nbsp;came into force, the Canadian Safeguards Support Program was initiated,&nbsp;the <em>Nuclear Control and Administration Act</em>&nbsp;was tabled in the House of Commons and radioactive contamination clean-up initiatives were implemented.</p>
<p>The defining moment of Prince&#39;s time at the AECB arose with the crash of COSMOS 954, a nuclear-powered Soviet surveillance satellite that scattered radioactive debris over a 124,000 km<sup>2</sup>-area in Canada&#39;s Northwest Territories when it re-entered the atmosphere. Together with the U.S., Canada coordinated a clean-up initiative called Operation Morning Light which deployed 200 people to work in the affected region. The AECB was responsible for retrieving and handling radioactive materials, and for conducting environmental and health assessments. </p>
<p>Following the COSMOS 954 incident, there was a call by Canada, the U.S. and other countries to prohibit satellites from containing radioactive materials. In November 1978, the United Nations authorized its Committee on the Peaceful Use of Outer Space to establish a working group to increase the safety of this technology in the exploration of space.</p>  </div>

<p className="mrgn-tp-0">Donald  Geoffrey Hurst was the President of the AECB from 1970 to 1974. His  term coincided with a significant transition period in the nuclear  sector, including the development of international non-proliferation  strategies, the discovery of radioactive contamination in Port Hope  and the construction of the first nuclear reactors in Canada.</p>
<p>Hurst  had significant experience working within the Canadian nuclear  sector, which allowed him to address the challenges presented during  the early 1970s, and he became known as an influential AECB  president. </p>
<p>Donald  Hurst was born in St. Austell, England, in 1911. As a child, he  immigrated to Canada with his family, spending most of his early life  in Montr&eacute;al, Quebec. He completed bachelor&#39;s, master&#39;s and doctoral  degrees in physics at McGill University. His studies enabled him to  pursue post-doctoral work at Berkeley University and Cambridge  University. </p>
<p>An  early interest in nuclear physics opened doors for Hurst. While  studying at Berkeley, Hurst worked with the newly invented Lawrence  cyclotron, an accelerator of subatomic particles. Hurst was also  granted access to the Cockcroft cyclotron while at Cambridge  University.</p>
<p>Returning  to Canada in 1939, Hurst joined the National Research Council. In  1945, he moved to Chalk River as part of the NRC&#39;s Atomic Energy  Project. In 1952, this project evolved and became Atomic Energy of  Canada Limited (AECL), where Hurst was the Assistant Director of  Reactor Research and Development. From 1965 to 1967, he took a leave  of absence from the AECL to serve as Director of the Division of  Nuclear Power and Reactors with the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA).</p>
<p>Retiring  in 1974, Hurst continued to dedicate himself to the nuclear sector.  He remained the Chairman of the AECB&#39;s Reactor Safety Advisory  Committee for Ontario Reactors, Executive Director of the Royal  Society of Canada, the Chairman and Canadian member of the IAEA&#39;s  Senior Advisory Group for the Production of Safety Codes and Guides,  and a co-author of the book <em>Canada  Enters the Nuclear Age</em>.</p>  </div>

<p>Following his studies, Prince worked at the National Research Council in Ottawa and at various federal agencies in roles of increasing responsibility, before joining the AECB in 1975. </p>
<p>During his time as President, Prince focused on making communication with Canadians a priority, which continues to this day. He also placed importance on the nuclear sector's responsibility to be accountable for its decisions. Consequently,&nbsp;the <em>Nuclear Liability Act</em>&nbsp;came into force, the Canadian Safeguards Support Program was initiated,&nbsp;the <em>Nuclear Control and Administration Act</em>&nbsp;was tabled in the House of Commons and radioactive contamination clean-up initiatives were implemented.</p>
<p>The defining moment of Prince's time at the AECB arose with the crash of COSMOS 954, a nuclear-powered Soviet surveillance satellite that scattered radioactive debris over a 124,000 km<sup>2</sup>-area in Canada's Northwest Territories when it re-entered the atmosphere. Together with the U.S., Canada coordinated a clean-up initiative called Operation Morning Light which deployed 200 people to work in the affected region. The AECB was responsible for retrieving and handling radioactive materials, and for conducting environmental and health assessments. </p>
<p>Following the COSMOS 954 incident, there was a call by Canada, the U.S. and other countries to prohibit satellites from containing radioactive materials. In November 1978, the United Nations authorized its Committee on the Peaceful Use of Outer Space to establish a working group to increase the safety of this technology in the exploration of space.</p>  </div>

<h3>Bruce Power</h3>
<h4>Date of event: January 19, 2022</h4>
<p><a href=
"https://www.brucepower.com/2022/01/19/bruce-a-update-4/">Bruce
Power Nuclear Generating Station</a></p>
<p>We were informed by Bruce Power that Unit 1 was taken offline
due to a moderator spill into the powerhouse. A radiation alert was
declared to isolate the area of the spill and conduct personnel
accounting.</p>
<p>Our staff continue to monitor the situation and will provide
updates as more information becomes available.</p>
<p>There are no injuries to plant personnel and no impact on the
protection of the public or environment.</p>
<p>Unit 1 is presently shut down and in a safe state. Given that
the unit was recently refurbished, there is no requirement to seek
approval from the Commission to restart once the issue is
resolved.</p>

<h4>Date of event: December 3, 2021</h4>
<p><a href=

Point Lepreau Generating Station</a></p>
<p>We were informed by NB Power of a truck making contact with a
power line resulting in a small fire and local power outage.</p>
<p>As a precautionary measure the ambulance and local fire response
services are on site. There is no impact on the safe operations of
the facility.</p>
<h3>Bruce Power</h3>
<h4>Date of event: July 5, 2021</h4>
<p>We were informed by Bruce Power that some pressure tube
inspections of its reactor Units 3 and 6 that are currently shut
down are indicating higher measurements of hydrogen equivalent
(Heq) than predicted, exceeding the limits set out in the power
reactor operating licence conditions.</p>
<p>The reactors with the higher hydrogen content in pressure tubes
continue to be safely shut down for refurbishment and maintenance
outages and do not pose a safety concern to the public or
environment. Hydrogen content is not a concern when reactors are
shut down or when they have reached operating temperature.</p>
<p>Since hydrogen content can only be measured while the units are
shut down, CNSC staff have directed Bruce Power to assess the
fitness for service of its other operating reactors and issued
formal notices to all nuclear power plant licensees in Canada
requiring timely review and reporting on the continued safe
operation of pressure tubes.</p>

<p><strong>Update on Bruce Power event</strong></p>
<p>The August 2, 2017 leak at the Bruce A Nuclear Generating
Station involving the failure of primary heat transport pump seals
has been stopped and the water recovered into drums. Onsite CNSC
inspectors continue to provide regulatory oversight to determine
the cause of the event. There were no detectable releases of
radionuclides from the facility. The event did not require a report
to the Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change
(MOECC), but it will be reported at the public Commission meeting
on August 16, 2017 as part of the Power Reactor Status Report. Unit
3 remains shut down as part of a planned maintenance outage.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.brucepower.com/">Bruce A Nuclear

<p>The CNSC was informed by Bruce Power, in accordance with its
licence conditions, of a failure of the primary heat transport pump
seals on a pump in Unit 3 at the Bruce A Nuclear Generating
Station. This resulted in a release of tritiated water. The release
was contained to the building, and cleanup is in progress. There
are no safety concerns for members of the public or workers, and no
releases above regulatory limits to the environment are
anticipated. CNSC inspectors are onsite and investigating.</p>

<p>Sunday, March 26, 2017 an electrical worker on the
non-radiological side of the station received an electrical shock
and was taken to hospital. The worker remains in stable condition.
All electrical work was stopped until further investigation of the
incident was completed.</p>
<p>The worker was performing maintenance on a circuit breaker in
Unit 5. The engineering barrier, in place to protect workers from
electrical voltage, failed to operate resulting in the worker
injury.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Labour was notified and Bruce Power is
conducting its own investigation to fully understand what happened
and how to prevent similar incidents in the future.</p>
<p>There is no impact to the health and safety of the public or the
environment due to this event.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> The investigation to the worker injury
of March 26, 2017 is ongoing. The details of the cause have yet to
be determined. CNSC staff will provide an update at the next

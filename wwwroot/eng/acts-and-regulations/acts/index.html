"http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-28.3/index.html"><em>Nuclear
Safety and Control Act</em></a> (NSCA)<br />
The NSCA came into force on May 31, 2000 when it replaced the
<em>Atomic Energy Control Act</em>. It established the Canadian
Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) and set out the CNSC's mandate,
responsibilities and powers. This Act provided the CNSC with the
authority to regulate the development, production and use of
nuclear energy and the production, possession and use of nuclear
substances, prescribed equipment and prescribed information in
Canada.</p>
<p>The CNSC also:</p>
<ul>
<li>conducts <a href=
"/eng/resources/environmental-assessments/index.cfm">environmental
assessments</a> under the <a href=
"http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-15.21/index.html"><em>Canadian
Environmental Assessment Act, 2012</em></a></li>
<li>implements Canada's bilateral agreement with the International
Atomic Energy Agency on <a href=
"/eng/resources/international-cooperation/index.cfm#verification">nuclear
safeguards verification</a></li>
<li>strengthens the compensation and civil liability regime for
damages that result from a nuclear accident under the <a href=
"http://www.laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-28.1/FullText.html"><em>Nuclear
Liability and Compensation Act</em></a></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the NSCA, other federal acts may apply to the
nuclear facilities and activities in Canada. Some of the more
important pieces of legislation include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#sec1">Nuclear security</a></li>
<li><a href="#sec2">Environment</a></li>
<li><a href="#sec3">Transportation</a></li>
<li><a href="#sec4">Occupational health and safety</a></li>
<li><a href="#sec5">Nuclear energy and substances</a></li>
</ul>

<em>Nuclear Terrorism Act</em></a><br />
Administered by <a href=
"http://www.canada.justice.gc.ca/eng/index.html">Department of
Justice</a><br />
Scope: The <em>Nuclear Terrorism Act</em> will help combat nuclear
terrorism by enhancing the domestic legal framework available to
respond to the threat posed by acts of nuclear terrorism and by
fulfilling key international commitments Canada has made in the
area of nuclear security.</p>
<p>The CNSC has been on the leading edge of implementing safety and
security of our nuclear material inventory here in Canada. Its work
is meant to be preventive so that nuclear terrorism efforts will be
detected and thwarted as early as possible.</p>

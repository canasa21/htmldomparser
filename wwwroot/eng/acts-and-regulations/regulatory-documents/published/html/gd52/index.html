<h2 id="P99_4312">1.0 Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="P100_4328">1.1 Purpose</h3>
<p>This guidance document provides information for a recommended
approach for meeting the requirements related to site description
and room design under paragraphs&nbsp;3(1)(<em>d</em>)
and&nbsp;3(1)(<em>l</em>) of the <em>Nuclear Substances and
Radiation Devices Regulations</em> and performing shielding design
analyses as a component of keeping doses As Low As Reasonably
Achievable (ALARA) pursuant to paragraph&nbsp;4(<em>a</em>) of the
<em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em>.</p>
<h3 id="P102_4769">1.2 Scope</h3>
<p>This guidance document provides design recommendations for a
nuclear medicine room or a nuclear substance laboratory where
unsealed nuclear substances are to be used, and an approach for
submitting the proposed design to the Canadian Nuclear Safety
Commission (CNSC).</p>
<p>It includes guidance on finishing and fixtures, plumbing,
storage, security, ventilation, shielding, and dose estimation for
basic, intermediate, high, and containment level nuclear substance
laboratories and nuclear medicine rooms.</p>
<h3 id="P105_5277">1.3 Relevant Regulations</h3>
<p>The provisions of the <em>Nuclear Safety and Control Act</em>
(NSCA) and the regulations made under the NSCA relevant to this
guide are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Subsection&nbsp;24(4) of the NSCA states that “No licence may
be issued, renewed, amended or replaced unless, in the opinion of
the Commission, the applicant (<em>a</em>)&nbsp;is qualified to
carry on the activity that the licence will authorize the licensee
to carry on; and (<em>b</em>)&nbsp;will, in carrying on that
activity, make adequate provision for the protection of the
environment, the health and safety of persons and the maintenance
of national security and measures required to implement
international obligations to which Canada has agreed.”</li>
<li>Section&nbsp;3 of the <em>General Nuclear Safety and Control
Regulations</em> provides a list of information which an
application for a licence shall contain.</li>
<li>Paragraph&nbsp;12(1)(<em>c</em>) of the <em>General Nuclear
Safety and Control Regulations</em> states that “Every licensee
shall take all reasonable precautions to protect the environment
and the health and safety of persons and to maintain
security.”</li>
<li>Paragraph&nbsp;3(1)(<em>d</em>) of the <em>Nuclear Substances
and Radiation Devices Regulations</em> states that “An application
for a licence in respect of a nuclear substance or a radiation
device, other than a licence to service a radiation device, shall
contain… (<em>d</em>)&nbsp;the proposed location of the activity to
be licensed, including a description of the site.”</li>
<li>Paragraph&nbsp;3(1)(<em>l</em>) of the <em>Nuclear Substances
and Radiation Devices Regulations</em> states that “An application
for a licence in respect of a nuclear substance or a radiation
device, other than a licence to service a radiation device, shall
contain, where the application is in respect of a nuclear substance
that is an unsealed source and that is to be used in a room, the
proposed design of the room.”</li>
<li>Subparagraph&nbsp;4(<em>a</em>)(iii) of the <em>Radiation
Protection Regulations</em> states that “Every licensee shall
implement a radiation protection program and shall, as part of that
program, (<em>a</em>)&nbsp;keep the amount of exposure to radon
progeny and the effective dose and equivalent dose received by and
committed to persons as low as is reasonably achievable, social and
economic factors being taken into account, through the
implementation of… (iii)&nbsp;control of occupational and public
exposure to radiation”.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="P113_7612">2.0 Licensing Process for Nuclear Substance
Laboratories and Nuclear Medicine Rooms</h2>
As part of the process to obtain a licence for the use of an
unsealed nuclear substance, applicants must submit a completed
licence application in accordance with section&nbsp;3 of the
<em>General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations</em>,
section&nbsp;3 of the <em>Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices
Regulations</em>, and section&nbsp;4 of the <em>Radiation
Protection Regulations</em>. As part of the licence application,
applicants must submit the proposed design of the room in which
unsealed nuclear substances will be used.
<p>The Design Assessment Form (DAF) provided in Appendix&nbsp;C of
this document assists licence applicants with the submission of the
proposed design of their nuclear medicine room or nuclear substance
laboratory. A DAF should be completed for any new construction or
major renovation (such as demolishing walls, changes to existing
shielding, or installing new fumehoods; for additional information,
contact a CNSC Licensing Specialist) and enclosed with the new
application or a request for amendment. A good laboratory design
facilitates adherence to safe policies and procedures.</p>
<p>The completed DAF should be submitted to the CNSC as early as
possible in the design stage in order to facilitate the processing
of the licence application or amendment. If multiple rooms are to
be constructed or renovated and are to be of similar design and
function, only one DAF needs to be submitted. Where more than one
laboratory or room for the handling of unsealed sources is to be
constructed or renovated, and the designation or use of each is
different, a separate DAF should be submitted for each laboratory
or room. CNSC staff may request additional information after the
initial design or renovation assessment is complete.</p>
<h2 id="P117_9407">3.0 Using the Design Assessment Form (DAF)</h2>
<p>The DAF is divided into the following categories:</p>
<dl class="table-display">
<dt>A</dt>
<dd>General Information;</dd>
<dt>B</dt>
<dd>Finishing and Fixtures;</dd>
<dt>C</dt>
<dd>Plumbing;</dd>
<dt>D</dt>
<dd>Security;</dd>
<dt>E</dt>
<dd>Ventilation;</dd>
<dt>F</dt>
<dd>Shielding/Dose Control; and</dd>
<dt>G</dt>
<dd>Miscellaneous.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The guidelines set out in the DAF are considered to be good
design features that contribute to the optimization of radiation
protection and keeping doses ALARA. The plans for the design,
construction, or renovation of all nuclear substance laboratories
and nuclear medicine rooms should incorporate the guidelines
applicable to the work to be performed.</p>
<p>Any proposed variation from the guidelines should be supported
by additional information to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of
CNSC staff, that the guideline is not applicable due to the nature
of the proposed activities, or that the guideline is addressed by
alternative measures that provide an equivalent degree of
safety.</p>
<h3 id="P138_10298">3.1 Supplementary Information for Part A of the
Design Assessment Form</h3>
<h4 id="P139_10368">3.1.1 Classification of Rooms</h4>
<p>Part&nbsp;A of the DAF asks for general information, including
the classification of the room in which the nuclear substance will
be used. Rooms where unsealed nuclear substances are used in
industrial, medical, or academic research settings are classified
by the CNSC as basic, intermediate, high, or containment-level
laboratories, or as nuclear medicine rooms, depending on the amount
of nuclear substances handled in the room and on the nature of the
work performed.</p>
<p>All areas, rooms, and enclosures where more than one exemption
quantity<sup><a href="#P142_10934" id="P142_10935">1</a></sup> of
an unsealed nuclear substance is used at a single time are
classified by the CNSC according to Table&nbsp;A. If the area,
room, or enclosure is used only for storage of unsealed nuclear
substances or for the use or storage of sealed nuclear substances
or radiation devices, the classifications in Table&nbsp;A do not
apply.</p>
<p>As per licence conditions, nuclear medicine departments and
clinics shall designate all rooms that will be used to prepare
nuclear substances for administration to a person, or to administer
the nuclear substance to a person, as “nuclear medicine” rooms.</p>
<p>With respect to veterinary nuclear medicine departments or
clinics, CNSC classifies the area or enclosure as Basic,
Intermediate, High, or Containment, according to Table&nbsp;A:</p>
<ol>
<li>Any area or enclosure where animals treated with more than one
exemption quantity of a nuclear substance are housed, and</li>
<li>Any area or enclosure where more than one exemption quantity of
an unsealed nuclear substance is used at a single time.</li>
</ol>

</table>
<p>Note that the appropriate ALI value is the one that best
represents the risks associated with the nuclear substance. If it
cannot be determined whether the greater risk is related to
inhalation or ingestion of the substance, then the most restrictive
value should be used. For a list of Annual Limits on Intake (ALIs),
refer to Appendix A.</p>
<p>For licence applications, all pertinent information must be
submitted. The DAF is provided to facilitate the process of
submitting the pertinent information. Once the licence has been
issued, future basic-level laboratories do not require submission
of the information in the DAF. For all other room classifications,
future additional rooms or renovations require submission of all
pertinent information and it is recommended that a completed DAF be
included.</p>
<p id="P142_10934"><sup><a href="#P142_10935">1</a></sup> For a
definition of exemption quantities, refer to section&nbsp;1 of the
<em>Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices Regulations</em>. For
a list of exemption quantities, refer to Schedule&nbsp;1,
column&nbsp;3 of those regulations.</p>
<p id="P160_12789"><sup><a href="#P160_12790">2</a></sup> In the
context of this guide, the term “nuclear medicine room” refers
strictly to any area or enclosure that is used for the preparation
of, or medical administration of, nuclear substances to persons via
injection, inhalation, or ingestion, for the purpose of diagnosing
or treating disease and for human research studies (excluding
medical diagnostic x-rays or the medical use of sealed nuclear
substances for brachytherapy or teletherapy treatments).</p>
<h3 id="P166_14113">3.2 Supplementary Information for Part F of the
Design Assessment Form</h3>
<p>As per subparagraph&nbsp;4(<em>a</em>)(<em>iii</em>) of the
<em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em>, the concept of
optimization of radiation protection (i.e., ALARA) must be
considered when designing any facility where nuclear substances
will be used. With nuclear medicine, this is especially important
given that the source, once administered in a person, will not be
in a fixed location. At the planning and design stage, the impact
of design decisions on potential doses to persons (excluding the
patient) should be a prime consideration.</p>
<p>Assessments of applications with respect to any nuclear medicine
room, any high or containment level laboratory, or any area or
enclosure associated with veterinary nuclear medicine will include
the review of dose estimates for persons (excluding the patient) in
the areas where the unsealed nuclear substances will be used. The
purpose of this section is to provide guidance on how to determine
and demonstrate that radiation dose estimates are ALARA prior to
carrying out any licensed activities.</p>
<p>CNSC document G-129 rev&nbsp;1, <em>Keeping Radiation Exposures
and Doses “As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA)”</em>, provides
guidance on keeping doses ALARA.</p>
<h4 id="P170_15349">3.2.1 Dose Estimates for Nuclear Medicine Room
Design Applications</h4>
<p>Dose estimates will only give a reasonable representation of
potential exposures if the parameters are examined carefully to
ensure they properly characterize the design and operation of the
facility. The applicant or licensee should consider the following
parameters when calculating the dose estimates resulting from its
intended operations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Layout and construction;</li>
<li>Locations at which these nuclear substances and activities will
be used;</li>
<li>Distances between the nuclear substance or patient and the
occupied locations of other persons;</li>
<li>Occupancy of the other rooms in the nuclear medicine department
and surrounding areas by persons other than the patient (if the
facility has more than one floor, consider occupancy above and
below);</li>
<li>Nuclear substances and activities (Bq) to be used for the
nuclear medicine procedures performed; and</li>
<li>Maximum number of patients per procedure to be treated,
annually.</li>
</ol>
<p id="P178_16330"><strong>3.2.1.1 Dose Estimates for Conventional
Diagnostic Nuclear Medicine—A Five-Step Method</strong></p>
The following 5-step method for calculating dose estimates is a
suggested approach only; it does not restrict the applicant from
using other approaches. Each of these five steps is described in
greater detail in Appendix&nbsp;B using an example to illustrate
the overall method.
<p><strong>Step 1)</strong> Obtain architectural drawings or make
an accurate, scaled and dimensioned drawing of the facility and
surrounding areas.</p>
<p>The drawings need to show the locations where significant
quantities of nuclear substance will be present, and those occupied
locations where persons other than the patient might be expected to
be exposed to radiation as a result of the nuclear medicine
procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2)</strong> Identify the key locations where
nuclear substances are to be used and the number of procedures, as
well as the typical activity per procedure, for each of these
locations.</p>
<p>The key locations include both the rooms where any nuclear
substance will be administered to the patient and the main
post-administration locations occupied by patients, such as
injection rooms, designated waiting areas, gamma camera rooms, and
treadmill rooms. For each location and type of procedure
performed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Determine the nuclear substance and typical activity (MBq) to
be used for each procedure; and</li>
<li>Estimate the approximate number of procedures to be performed
per year.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Step 3)</strong> Identify the purpose, type of occupancy
and occupancy factor of those areas within, or in the immediate
vicinity of, the nuclear medicine department, that will be occupied
while nuclear substances are in use.</p>
<p>For each area in which persons (other than the patient) would be
expected to receive a radiation dose as a consequence of nuclear
medicine activities, determine:</p>
<ol>
<li>What the area is used for (e.g., reception desk, waiting room,
gamma camera room, washroom, etc.);</li>
<li>The persons who are normally present in the area, including:
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Staff who are nuclear energy workers (NEWs), such as nuclear
medicine technologists;</li>
<li>Staff who are non-NEWs and are occupationally exposed; and</li>
<li>Non-NEWs who are members of the general public and are
non-occupationally exposed, such as persons accompanying
patients.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The occupancy factor (T) for each location and exposed group
(i.e., the fraction of total time during which a radiation field
may be present at a particular location, for which another
individual may be present at that location). For additional
information, refer to the National Council on Radiation Protection
and Measurements (NCRP) Report No.&nbsp;151: <em>Structural
Shielding Design and Evaluation for Megavoltage X- and Gamma-Ray
Radiotherapy Facilities</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>When evaluating T, an important consideration is whether or not
a person may be at the location of interest <em>while there is a
radiation field present in that area</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4)</strong> Estimate the radiation dose rates
produced in each potentially occupied area.</p>
<p>Two basic methods are used to estimate the radiation dose rates
to which a person (excluding the patient) will be exposed as a
result of typical nuclear medicine operations.</p>
<p>The first method is to take direct measurements of the dose
rates in surrounding areas, using a sufficiently sensitive,
properly calibrated radiation survey meter or other, equivalent
method. The type, model, energy range, and energy response of the
dose rate meter to be used should be provided. This method is
generally useful when evaluating an existing department, or when
making a comparative analysis for designing a new room or
department that is very similar in layout and design to an existing
site. It is particularly useful when an applicant needs to analyze
the impact of proposed changes, such as increased workload or
changes to the facility layout.</p>
<p>The second method is a mathematical approach that relies, for
example, on the known physical properties of the nuclear substances
being used, the distances to each occupied area and the shielding
properties and thickness of the building materials. This method is
generally useful when designing a new room or department. This
technique is described in detail in the example provided as
Appendix&nbsp;B of this guide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5)</strong> Extrapolate the measured or calculated
dose rates at each location to annual doses for the persons who may
occupy each area, based on the projected facility workload and the
occupancy factor.</p>
<p>Patients typically occupy several different locations over the
course of the nuclear medicine procedure and may contribute to the
dose received by a person occupying a single location (e.g., the
dose from patients in the injection room, scanner rooms, and
post-injection waiting areas may all contribute to the dose
received by the receptionist at the front desk). Exposed persons
may also occupy several different areas over the course of any
given day, some of which may contribute far more significantly to
the total radiation dose they incur. Methods of calculating annual
doses from measured or calculated dose rates are also described in
detail in Appendix&nbsp;B of this guide.</p>
<p id="P203_21390"><strong>3.2.1.2 Dose Estimates for Positron
Emission Tomography (PET) Applications</strong></p>
<p>The basic approach to Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
shielding design is similar to that for conventional diagnostic
nuclear medicine described in subsection&nbsp;3.2.1.1, <em>Dose
Estimates for Conventional Diagnostic Nuclear Medicine—A Five-Step
Method</em>. The significant difference is in the details; for
example, the thickness of shielding required, due to the higher
energy 511&nbsp;keV annihilation gammas that are produced.</p>
<p>In such cases, the use of lead may be impractical because of
weight and structural considerations. Concrete, either in the form
of poured slabs or solid concrete block, is generally a more viable
solution to PET shielding issues. The choice of shielding materials
is ultimately left to the licensee.</p>
<p>The <em>Medical Physics</em> periodical (33,&nbsp;1; January
2006) provides useful technical information and guidance on
shielding requirements and dose estimates specifically related to
PET operations&nbsp;[1].</p>
<p id="P207_22379"><strong>3.2.1.3 Dose Estimates for In-Patient
<sup>131</sup>I Therapy Applications</strong></p>
<p>There is very little difference between conventional diagnostic
nuclear medicine dose estimates and those for in-patient nuclear
medicine treatments, such as <sup>131</sup>I thyroid cancer
treatment. However, the patient is typically isolated in a
dedicated treatment room on one of the wards.</p>
<p>The basic approach to <sup>131</sup>I in-patient therapy room
shielding calculations is similar to that for conventional
diagnostic nuclear medicine described in subsection&nbsp;3.2.1.1,
<em>Dose Estimates for Conventional Diagnostic Nuclear Medicine—A
Five-Step Method</em>. The significant difference is that, as a
condition of the licence, the design must be such that the dose
rate in occupied areas around the treated patient’s room does not
exceed 2.5&nbsp;µSv/hour or that other patients do not receive a
dose in excess of 500&nbsp;µSv per hospital stay.</p>
<h4 id="P210_23259">3.2.2 Dose Estimates for High and Containment
Level Laboratories</h4>
<p>For high and containment level laboratories, doses should also
be considered at the planning stage. In this case, localized
shielding is typically used to ensure dose rates in the surrounding
areas are acceptable. The main sources of radiation and the
shielding materials should be considered, and resulting dose rates
should be provided (by measurement or by calculation). Occupancy of
persons in adjacent or nearby areas should be considered and
resulting annual doses determined. The intended use of procedural
and work practice controls should also be considered and
explained.</p>
<p>If specific dose estimates are required, CNSC staff may request
additional information upon submission of the application.</p>
<h4 id="P213_24026">3.2.3 Dose Estimates for Nuclear Substance
Laboratories in Veterinary Nuclear Medicine</h4>
<p>Dose estimates for veterinary nuclear medicine are very similar
to dose estimates for conventional diagnostic nuclear medicine.
Therefore, the approach to veterinary nuclear medicine shielding
calculations is the same as that for conventional diagnostic
nuclear medicine (see subsection&nbsp;3.2.1.1, <em>Dose Estimates
for Conventional Diagnostic Nuclear Medicine—A Five-Step
Method</em>).</p>

Estimates</h2>
<p>The following example demonstrates one method (as introduced in
subsection&nbsp;3.2.1.1, <em>Dose Estimates for Conventional
Diagnostic Nuclear Medicine—A Five-Step Method</em>), for
estimating the radiation doses from nuclear medicine operations.
The same approach can be used to estimate the shielding based on
dose targets.</p>
<h3 id="P791_32876">Appendix B1: Sample Calculation for Dose
Estimates for Nuclear Medicine Rooms</h3>
<p>Using the method outlined in subsection&nbsp;3.2.1.1, the
following approach can be used to estimate the doses to persons
(other than the patient) in and around a nuclear medicine room.</p>
<p><strong>Step&nbsp;1)</strong> Facility Layout</p>
<p>Figure&nbsp;B1 shows a hypothetical nuclear medicine department
layout. Dimensions and basic shielding details are shown. Key
locations where nuclear substances and nuclear medicine patients
will be present for significant periods of time over the course of
the workday are identified using letters A
to&nbsp;D<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p><strong>Step&nbsp;2)</strong> Estimating Workload</p>
<p>For any given nuclear medicine facility, several different gamma
emitting nuclear substances can be identified that are used
regularly (e.g., <sup>51</sup>Cr, <sup>67</sup>Ga,
<sup>99m</sup>Tc, <sup>111</sup>In, <sup>123</sup>I,
<sup>131</sup>I and <sup>201</sup>Tl). It is unlikely that all of
the nuclear substances will be used or will contribute
significantly to the annual dose at a particular location. Rather,
it is likely that only one or two nuclear substances and procedures
will be of importance.</p>
<p><strong><em>Example:</em></strong></p>
<p>Assume that the nuclear medicine department shown in
Figure&nbsp;1 primarily performs three types of outpatient
diagnostic procedures: cardiac analysis, diagnostic bone scans and
thyroid uptake analysis. The typical daily workload and details of
the nuclear substances and activities used are presented in
Table&nbsp;B1. The annual number of procedures performed is
estimated from the daily workload by assuming five days of
operation per week (procedures are not done on the weekends), 50
weeks per year.</p>

<p>* Assumes 35 minutes for rest test and 55 minutes for stress
test (90&nbsp;minutes total, or 1&nbsp;½ hours)</p>
<p>From the final column, it is reasonable to assume that, for this
example, the radiation doses incurred by staff or the general
public as a result of thyroid uptake procedures are negligible in
comparison with cardiac analysis or bone scans and can be omitted
from the dose estimation. However, all types of procedures, total
number of patients and average activities should be provided to the
CNSC and those used in the assessment should be justified.</p>
<p><strong>Step&nbsp;3)</strong> Occupancy Review</p>
<p>To begin, it must be determined who is exposed to radiation as a
consequence of the operation of the nuclear medicine department.
For compliance with the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em>,
these persons may be considered as either NEWs or non-NEWs.</p>
<p>According to the NSCA, a NEW is a person who is required, in the
course of the person’s business or occupation in connection with a
nuclear substance or nuclear facility, to perform duties in such
circumstances that there is a reasonable probability that the
person may receive a dose of radiation that is greater than the
prescribed limit for the general public, which is 1&nbsp;mSv. For
example, nuclear medicine technologists are usually designated as
NEWs.</p>
<p>Non-NEWs may be staff members or members of the general public,
and as such are subject to an annual effective dose limit of
1&nbsp;mSv.</p>
<p>Assessing the doses received by every individual from every
possible source is impractical, so the evaluation may be simplified
by evaluating the proximity, frequency, and duration of exposure
for persons in each group to establish the most exposed persons.
Only these “worst case” exposures within each group should be
evaluated, as all other persons within each group can be safely
assumed to receive lesser doses.</p>
<p>The final stage of the occupancy review determines:</p>
<ol>
<li>Where the nuclear substances and nuclear medicine patients are
present (see Figure&nbsp;B1, locations A, B, C, D<sub>1</sub>, and
D<sub>2</sub>) and for how long; and</li>
<li>Where the most exposed individuals (other than the patient
undergoing the nuclear medicine procedure) are present and for how
long.</li>
</ol>
<p>For each location in and around the facility where a significant
contribution to the total dose received by a person would be
expected, the dose to each representative person, assuming an
appropriate occupancy factor, should be determined. The presence of
NEWs, non-NEWs, or both, at these locations should be specified. If
an individual occupies several of these locations, the dose from
all locations should be totalled (this scenario should be
considered when assigning occupancy factors).</p>
<p>If occupancy factors are not known, NCRP&nbsp;151 provides
guidance on occupancy factors. NCRP&nbsp;151 also addresses issues
of ventilation, electrical outlets, and fixture design
considerations for radiation protected facilities.[4]</p>
<p><strong><em>Example:</em></strong></p>
<p>For the purposes of this example, assume the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is one full time receptionist for the nuclear medicine
department who spends most of their time in the reception office.
The same is true for the adjacent outpatient clinic.</li>
<li>Other ancillary staff, such as cleaning and maintenance staff,
are present only infrequently, with restricted access to areas in
which nuclear substances are used and with minimal direct exposure
to injected patients or radiopharmaceuticals.</li>
<li>Members of the general public who accompany the patients
undergoing nuclear medicine procedures do so a maximum of a few
times per year.</li>
<li>Physicians working in the adjacent outpatient clinic spend
approximately one half of their time in the examining rooms
immediately adjacent to the camera suites and stress testing
room.</li>
<li>The clinic is a single story building, built on grade, so there
is no occupancy below and very minimal occupancy above (e.g.,
during roof repairs).</li>
</ol>
<p>For this example, we assume that persons (other than the
patient) will occupy the following locations: the corridor, the
office, the camera room(s), the exam rooms in the neighbouring
clinic, and the reception area. These key locations cover areas of
occupancy of technicians (NEWs) and non-NEWs, including the
physician in the adjoining clinic. Other locations may also need to
be considered—the locations used in this example are for
illustrative purposes. The complete example in this guide is worked
out only for the reception area/receptionist. The same approach
would be used for the other locations or other representative
individuals.</p>
<p>The key parameters needed to estimate the total annual doses are
listed in Table&nbsp;B2.</p>

<p><strong>Step&nbsp;4)</strong> Dose Rate Calculations</p>
<p>The following approach assumes the source/patient can be
approximated as a point source. For most distances, the point
source is a sufficiently accurate representation. In addition, at
distances greater than 1&nbsp;meter, assuming point source geometry
is conservative compared to other viable geometrics such as a
volumetric source. The choice of source geometry is left to the
discretion of the applicant, but the method for estimation must be
clearfixly indicated.</p>
<p>A general formula for performing dose rate calculations for a
point source is:</p>

</table>
<p>Specific gamma ray constants are typically defined in terms of
the dose rate produced (e.g., μSv&nbsp;h<sup>-1</sup>) at one meter
from the source, per unit of source activity (e.g.,
MBq<sup>-1</sup>). When performing dose rate calculations, care
must be taken to ensure the consistency of units between
<em>R<sub>ij</sub></em>, Γ<em><sub>i</sub></em> and
<em>A<sub>i</sub></em>. Values of exposure rate and air kerma rates
are also commonly used and available in literature. These values
should be converted to values of dose rate.</p>
<p>Tenth value layer (TVL) thicknesses for common gamma-emitting
nuclear substances and various shielding materials are available
from a number of different sources&nbsp;[5]. Diagnostic nuclear
medicine rooms are typically shielded using commercially available
lead sheeting, with normal thicknesses varying from 0.8&nbsp;mm
(1/32&nbsp;inch) to 3.2&nbsp;mm (1/8&nbsp;inch). For poly-energetic
sources, the “first” broad beam TVL thickness may be much smaller
than subsequent TVLs due to the selective absorption of low energy
photons via photoelectric interactions. This effect is commonly
referred to as “radiation hardening” or “beam hardening”. For this
reason, care must be taken when evaluating transmission through
barriers greater than 1&nbsp;TVL thick for nuclear substances such
as <sup>67</sup>Ga, <sup>111</sup>In, <sup>123</sup>I,
<sup>131</sup>I, or <sup>201</sup>Tl.</p>
<p><strong><em>Example:</em></strong></p>
<p>Table B3 summarizes the parameters required to perform the dose
rate estimates for the receptionist. The distances
<em>d<sub>ij</sub></em> were measured directly from Figure&nbsp;B1.
Lead thicknesses are based on the assumption that all interior
walls of Stress Testing, Camera Room&nbsp;1, Camera Room&nbsp;2 and
the “hot” post-injection waiting room are lined with 1.6&nbsp;mm
(1/16&nbsp;inch) lead. All other interior walls are assumed to be
constructed of ordinary drywall (gypsum board) and to provide
minimal attenuation.</p>

rates at the reception desk resulting from bone scan and cardiac
stress test procedures. A sample calculation for one representative

for the exposed person and occupied location (<em>T</em>, see Table

duration of time (<em>S<sub>i</sub></em>) the source/injected

Calculations</a></p>
<p>The last column of Table B4 lists the calculated annual doses to
the reception area (for the receptionist), for both the bone scan
and cardiac procedures (note that for the reception area, the
exposure from the patient in the treadmill room (C) can be
neglected as was noted in Tables&nbsp;B2 and B3). A sample
calculation for one representative source location (D<sub>2</sub>)
and one part of the procedure (imaging after stress testing) is
given below:</p>

<h3 id="P1201_48523">Appendix B2: Conclusion</h3>
<p>The annual dose to the receptionist and reception area, assuming
100% occupancy, is less than 50&nbsp;µSv.</p>
<p>To complete the dose assessment, the annual doses would be
estimated for other staff and members of the general public, other
than the patient, who are in and around the nuclear medicine rooms
in the facility. The CNSC may consider that an ALARA assessment is
not required when individual occupational doses are unlikely to
exceed 1&nbsp;mSv per year, when the dose to individual members of
the public is unlikely to exceed 50&nbsp;µSv per year, and when the
annual collective dose (both occupational and public) is unlikely
to exceed 1&nbsp;person-Sv (as recommended in CNSC document G-129
rev&nbsp;1, <em>Keeping Radiation Doses and Exposures ALARA</em>,
as amended from time to time).</p>

<dt><strong>Annual Limit on Intake (ALI)</strong></dt>
<dd>The activity, in Becquerels, of a radionuclide that will
deliver an effective dose of 20&nbsp;mSv during the 50-year period
after the radionuclide is taken into the body of a person
18&nbsp;years old or older or during the period beginning at intake
and ending at age&nbsp;70 after it is taken into the body of a
person less than 18&nbsp;years old.</dd>
<dt><strong>DAF</strong></dt>
<dd>Design Assessment Form; provided as Appendix&nbsp;C of this
document.</dd>
<dt><strong>DCF</strong></dt>
<dd>Dose conversion factor; the committed effective dose in Sv, per
unit activity in Bq, delivered by a given radionuclide of a given
form. It is related to the ALI, in that the ALI can be calculated
by dividing the DCF into 0.02&nbsp;Sv (20&nbsp;mSv).</dd>
<dt><strong>HTO</strong></dt>
<dd>Hydrogenated Tritium Oxide; also referred to as “tritiated
water”.</dd>
<dt><strong>HVL</strong></dt>
<dd>See TVL/HVL.</dd>
<dt><strong>Nuclear Energy Worker (NEW)</strong></dt>
<dd>A person who is required, in the course of the person’s
business or occupation in connection with a nuclear substance or
nuclear facility, to perform duties in such circumstances that
there is a reasonable probability that the person may receive a
dose of radiation that is greater than the prescribed limit for the
general public.</dd>
<dt><strong>Nuclear Medicine Room</strong></dt>
<dd>In the context of this guide, the term “nuclear medicine room”
refers strictly to any area or enclosure that is used for the
preparation of, or medical administration of, nuclear substances to
persons via injection, inhalation, or ingestion, for the purpose of
diagnosing or treating disease and for human research studies
(excluding medical diagnostic x-rays or the medical use of sealed
nuclear substances for brachytherapy or teletherapy
treatments).</dd>
<dt><strong>Nuclear Substance Laboratory</strong></dt>
<dd>For the purposes of this document, any laboratory in which
unsealed nuclear substances are used (also referred to as
“radioisotope laboratory”).</dd>
<dt><strong>OBT</strong></dt>
<dd>Organically Bound Tritium.</dd>
<dt><strong>Occupancy Factor</strong></dt>
<dd>The fraction of total time during which a radiation field is
present at a particular location, for which an individual is
present at that location. For example, if a person spends four
hours each day near a camera room that is fully occupied each hour
of an eight-hour workday, then the occupancy factor
is&nbsp;0.5.</dd>
<dt><strong>PET</strong></dt>
<dd>Positron emission tomography; an imaging procedure that detects
gamma rays that are emitted when positrons from a positron emitting
source (such as F-18) collide with electrons in tissue.</dd>
<dt>Poly-energetic source</dt>
<dd>A source that has multiple radiation emissions of unique
energies.</dd>
<dt><strong>TVL/HVL</strong></dt>
<dd>Tenth Value Layer; the thickness of material that attenuates
90% of the incident gamma rays (i.e., reduces the incident gamma
rays to 10%). Similarly, the Half Value Layer is the thickness of
material that attenuates 50% of the incident gamma rays (i.e.,
reduces the incident gamma rays to&nbsp;50%).</dd>

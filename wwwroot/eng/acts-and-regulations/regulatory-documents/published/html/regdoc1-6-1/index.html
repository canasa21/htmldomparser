<title>REGDOC-1.6.1: Licence Application Guide: Nuclear Substances
and Radiation Devices</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>This regulatory document&nbsp;is part of the CNSC’s&nbsp;Nuclear
Substances and Devices series of regulatory documents. The
full&nbsp;list of regulatory document series&nbsp;is included at
the end of this document and can also be found on the <a href=
"http://www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/acts-and-regulations/regulatory-documents/index.cfm">
CNSC's website</a>.</p>
<p>In accordance with the <em>Nuclear Safety and Control Act</em>
(NSCA) and the regulations made under the NSCA, individuals wanting
to possess, use, store, transfer, import, export, service and
abandon nuclear substances and radiation devices require a licence
issued by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC). The NSCA
prohibits the CNSC from issuing a licence unless the CNSC considers
that the applicant is qualified, has made adequate provision for
the protection of the environment and the health and safety of
persons, and otherwise meets the requirements of the provisions of
the NSCA and the Regulations.</p>
<p>Regulatory document REGDOC-1.6.1, <em>Licence Application Guide:
Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices</em>, sets out guidance
for applicants in the preparation and submission of an application
for a licence to carry out activities related to nuclear substances
and radiation devices. REGDOC 1.6.1 will document and clarify the
CNSC’s current expectations. It is not expected to result in new or
increased obligations for licensees.</p>
<p>REGDOC-1.6.1 supersedes RD/GD-371 <em>Licence Application Guide:
Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices</em> which was published
in November 2011.</p>
<p>Guidance contained in this document exists to inform the
applicant, to elaborate further on requirements or to provide
direction to licensees and applicants on how to meet requirements.
It also provides more information about how CNSC staff evaluate
specific problems or data during their review of licence
applications. Licensees are expected to review and consider
guidance; should they choose not to follow it, they should explain
how their chosen alternate approach meets regulatory
requirements.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="sec5">5. Part A – Applicant information</h2>
<p>In this part of the application, the CNSC requires specific
information on the entity to be licensed, including complete
contact information and proof of legal status.</p>
<h3>A.1 Type of request</h3>
<p>Mark the relevant box and indicate if this application is to
obtain:</p>
<ul>
<li>a new licence</li>
<li>renewal of an existing licence</li>
</ul>
<p>For renewals, indicate the current licence number.</p>
<h3>A.2 Language of licence</h3>
<p>Identify the official language(s) preferred for the printed copy
of the licence.</p>
<h3>A.3 Public access to information</h3>
<p>Indicate whether or not any part of this application is subject
to a request for exemption from the CNSC policy on public access to
the information encompassing the licence. A request for exemption
should be made in writing to the CNSC detailing the applicant’s
basis and reasons for such an exemption.</p>
<h3>A.4 Name of applicant</h3>
<p>In this section, provide the legal name of the person,
institution or corporation who will be referred to as the
“licensee” on the issued licence.</p>
<p>Indicate the name as it appears on the proof of legal status
documentation, such as the proof of incorporation or sole
proprietorship.</p>
<p>An individual may be the Applicant only if they will be solely
responsible for the licence and are not a corporation or
institution.</p>
<p>The <em>General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations</em>
require notification to the CNSC in the event of a change in the
applicant’s name during the valid period of the licence.</p>
<h3>A.5 Eligibility of applicant</h3>
<p>The <em>Nuclear Safety and Control Act</em> (NSCA) allows for a
“person” to be authorized to conduct licensed activities. In order
to ensure the necessary accountability and responsibility, the
Applicant must be a “person”, which is a natural person (an
individual), a government or public institution incorporated
through enabling legislation or a corporate person (a corporation).
General or limited partnerships are not eligible to be an Applicant
since the CNSC cannot license a partnership under the NSCA, as they
do not specifically meet the legal definition of a “person”.</p>
<p>The applicant must indicate whether the application is from a
natural person (individual/sole proprietorship), a public
institution or a corporation (incorporated company).</p>
<p>A sole proprietorship is where the business is owned and
operated by one individual and where there is no legal distinction
between the owner and the business.</p>
<p>A public institution is any non-incorporated government
department or agency, any non-incorporated public institution or
any other site which is set up under enabling legislation.</p>
<p>An incorporated company is any incorporated business,
institution or company where incorporation is carried out under
federal or provincial authorization.</p>
<p>Append information that establishes the applicant as a “person”
for the purpose of this application.</p>
<h3>A.6 Proof of legal status</h3>
<p>If the Applicant is a corporation it needs to submit proof of
incorporation and an official corporation profile report which sets
out various information about the corporation, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>corporation’s legal name</li>
<li>corporation number</li>
<li>date of incorporation</li>
<li>corporate status (showing it is still active)</li>
<li>registered office address</li>
<li>corporate history (providing details such as corporate
amalgamations, corporate name changes)</li>
</ul>
<p>An official corporation profile report can be obtained from
Industry Canada for federally incorporated companies under the
<em>Canada Business Corporations Act</em>, R.S.C., c. C-44 and is
referred to as a “Strategis Report”. For provincially incorporated
corporations, similar corporation profile reports are available and
for more information you should contact the provincial department
where your corporation was registered.</p>
<p>The <em>General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations</em>
require notification to the CNSC in the event of a change in the
applicant’s legal status during the valid period of the
licence.</p>
<p>For Public Institution, specify the name of the enabling
legislation (act) under which the institution was created.</p>
<p>The Business Number (BN) identifier is assigned to each business
or other entity by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).</p>
<h3>A.7 Financial contact person</h3>
<p>Provide the name and contact information of the person to be
contacted regarding payment of fees for the licence.</p>

workers (NEWs) including their job category.</p>
<p><em>D.2.3</em> The applicant must append its policy for
informing in writing NEWs as well as the procedures used to provide
specific instructions to them.</p>
<p>The <em>General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations</em> and
the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em> require that NEWs be
notified in writing of their status as NEWs and all associated
implications. These include the risks related to the radiation to
which NEWs may be exposed, applicable effective dose limits,
typical dose levels received and the NEWs’ rights and obligations
as specified by the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em>.
Applicants must also include the information provided to NEWs
regarding the rights and obligations of pregnant nuclear energy
workers.</p>
<p>A licensee must obtain written acknowledgement from each NEW
that this information has been received. A sample form that may be
used to inform workers of their NEW status can be found in
Appendix&nbsp;D: Notification of Nuclear Energy Worker Status
(Example).</p>
<p>For the criteria to designate workers as NEWs, refer to the
Radiation Protection Regulations.</p>
<h3>D.3 Worker training and authorization</h3>
<p>Append a detailed description of the applicant’s
proposed/existing radiation safety training program for each job
category.</p>
<p>Workers should not be authorized to work with nuclear substances
or radiation devices until they have successfully completed
appropriate training.</p>
<p>Retraining should be given following any significant change in
their work. Periodic refresher training is also recommended.</p>
<p>It should not be assumed that radiation safety training obtained
by workers in prior occupations or academic certification is
adequate for an applicant’s operations. As a minimum, training
should be site-specific, task-specific and tailored to the
education, background and practical needs of each trainee.</p>
<p>In addition, to promote a good safety culture, it is recommended
that a licensee’s basic radiation safety training be extended to
auxiliary personnel (e.g., clerical, janitorial, maintenance,
security).</p>
<p>An example of a training record can be found in Appendix&nbsp;E:
Training Record (Example).</p>
<h3>D.4 Ascertaining and recording doses to workers</h3>
<p><em>D.4.1</em> Append a copy of the procedures for ascertaining
and recording the radiation dose received by all workers as a
result of licensed activities (i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and
neutron).</p>
<p>The applicant must include information regarding external and
internal radiation monitoring programs to be used for the proposed
licensed activity. For external monitoring, this may include
information for whole body, skin, extremity and lens of the eye
monitoring. For internal monitoring, this may include information
on urine bioassay, thyroid bioassay or other measurements of
internal intakes.</p>
<p>If a dosimetry service is required to be used, identify the name
of the CNSC licensed dosimetry service provider that will be used
for any and all monitoring of workers.</p>
<p><em>D.4.2</em> For new licences, provide dose estimates for all
categories of workers.</p>
<p><em>D.4.3</em> For renewals, append a summary of the annual
radiation doses for all of the licensee’s monitored workers. For
groups of monitored workers who have significantly different
exposure levels, the summaries should be grouped by similar job
types, types of exposure, nuclear substances and radiation devices
used and/or work location.</p>
<p>Do not include the dose result information obtained from the
dosimetry service provider. This information contains dose results
for specifically named persons and is considered personal medical
information and must be kept private in accordance with the
<em>Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents
Act</em>.</p>
<p>Please include the summary chart of doses to workers from the
most recent Annual Compliance Report (ACR).</p>
<p>As specified in the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em>,
identify the job positions whose recorded radiation dose is likely
to exceed 5.0 mSv per year of whole body dose.</p>
<p>The CNSC has prepared guidance documents regarding ascertaining
and recording of radiation doses to individuals. Workers must be
either monitored directly or by estimation of doses based on
workplace monitoring.</p>
<h3>D.5 Action levels</h3>
<p>Action levels are designed to alert licensees before regulatory
limits are reached. In section 6 of the <em>Radiation Protection
Regulations</em>, an action level is defined as a “specific dose of
radiation or other parameter that, if reached, may indicate a loss
of control on the part of the licensee’s radiation protection
program and triggers a requirement for specific action to be
taken.”</p>
<p>Action levels are required to be established for industrial
radiography and logging sealed sources licences (use-types 812 and
816); however, the CNSC strongly encourages all applicants to
provide action levels in order to manage their radiation protection
programs. Action levels should be based on the average in the
industry.</p>
<p>If action levels are a component of the radiation protection
program, they should be identified as part of the application. If
appropriate, they may be referred to in a licence. When a licensee
becomes aware that an action level referred to in a licence has
been reached, the licensee is obligated to comply with the related
licence conditions and the <em>Radiation Protection
Regulations</em> by investigating, taking corrective action and
notifying the CNSC.</p>
<h3>D.6 Control of radioactive contamination (where unsealed
materials are used or stored)</h3>
<p><em>D.6.1</em> Append the policy and procedures for maintaining
contamination control.</p>
<p>Conditions of a licence typically require that removable
contamination does not exceed radionuclide-specific limits on

<p>For control areas, removable surface-contamination limit
criteria averaging over an area not exceeding 100 cm<sup>2</sup>
are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>3.0 Bq/cm<sup>2</sup> for Class A radionuclides, which are
typically long-lived and emit alpha radiation</li>
<li>30 Bq/cm<sup>2</sup> for Class B radionuclides, which are
typically long-lived and emit beta or gamma radiation</li>
<li>300 Bq/cm<sup>2</sup> for Class C radionuclides, which are
typically short-lived and emit beta or gamma radiation</li>
</ul>
<p>For supervised public areas and for decommissioning, removable
surface-contamination limit criteria averaging over an area not
exceeding 100 cm2 are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>0.3 Bq/cm<sup>2</sup> for Class A radionuclides</li>
<li>3.0 Bq/cm<sup>2</sup> for Class B radionuclides</li>
<li>30 Bq/cm<sup>2</sup> for Class C radionuclides</li>
</ul>

practitioner:</em></strong></p>
<p>A physician acting as the medical practitioner must be qualified
under provincial law to provide the medical supervision encompassed
by the activities of the licence for which the application is made.
When submitting an application for any activities involving nuclear
medicine or human research, the person who will be acting as the
medical practitioner must supply their name and contact details,
provincial registration number and sign the declaration that they
are qualified pursuant to s.16 of the <em>Nuclear Substances and
Radiation Devices Regulations</em>.</p>
<p>If there is more than one medical practitioner, provide a
separate form for each.</p>
<h3>E.2 Therapeutic nuclear medicine (use-type 872)</h3>
<p><em>E.2.1</em> <em><strong>Administration of nuclear medicine
therapy doses:</strong></em></p>
<p>Append the policy and procedures for delivering radiation doses
to patients for therapeutic reasons during the activities to be
licensed, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the preparations to be undertaken prior to administering
nuclear substances</li>
<li>the proposed manner of administering nuclear substances</li>
<li>the precautions to be followed after administering the nuclear
substance</li>
<li>method for controlling radiation exposures of patients and
non-patients</li>
<li>whether doses are administered on in-patient or out-patient

</ul>
<p>A specific procedure must be submitted for each nuclear
substance authorized by the therapeutic licence.</p>
<p>All policies and procedures should demonstrate that the
effective dose limits set out in the <em>Radiation Protection
Regulations</em> will be met during the proposed activity. These
procedures should also recognize the challenges associated with the
discharge of materials and fluids from the treated patient.</p>
<p>For patients treated with nuclear substances other than
Iodine-131, the associated safety requirements will depend upon the
characteristics (e.g., type of emissions, biological half-life) of
the nuclear substances used and other factors such as the routes of
excretion.</p>
<p>The licensee must have procedures for the care and management of
patients who are deceased following internal administration or
implantation of therapeutic nuclear substances, including policies
for cremation or other disposition of the body.</p>
<p><em>E.2.2</em> <em><strong>Instructions to
caregivers:</strong></em></p>
<p>Append the precautionary instructions that are to be given to
persons who will care for a patient who has undergone nuclear
medicine therapy. Provide instructions for all potential caregivers
such as medical professionals, hospital workers and persons who may
provide extended-care and home-care services.</p>
<p>Good hygiene practices, infection control measures and universal
precautions are typically sufficient to address most hazards
associated with caring for a person who has undergone nuclear
medicine therapy. However, special precautions are usually
necessary to control the spread of radioactive contamination due to
the excretions of nuclear medicine patients.</p>
<p><em>E.2.3</em> <em><strong>Instructions to patients of nuclear
medicine therapy and their families:</strong></em></p>
<p>Append the precautionary instructions that are to be given to
patients and their family members who have recently received
nuclear medicine therapy in order to control radioactive
contamination effects and radiation exposures to others. The
proposed precautionary measures should take into account the
radiation exposure limit that, typically, is set as a condition for
the patient’s release from the hospital or treatment facility.</p>
<p>The precautionary instructions must include information on any
requirements, restrictions or prohibitions for the management of
the patient if they become deceased after internal administration
or implantation of the therapeutic nuclear substance. This should
include information on possible retrieval of implants or
restrictions for cremation of remains.</p>
<p><em>E.2.4</em> <em><strong>Release of
patients:</strong></em></p>
<p>Append the policy and procedures for determining when patients
that have received nuclear medicine therapy must be isolated and
when they may be released from isolation. Propose the patient’s
radiation activity level, that is to be used to determine when the
patient must be isolated from other patients, as well as the limit
below which no further precautions for radiation protection
purposes will be required.</p>
<p>Recommendations concerning isolation or release of patients
treated with Iodine-131 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the activity remaining in the patient after treatment is
less than 300 MBq and the approximate radiation dose rate at 2 m is
less than 4 µSv/h, no hospitalization and only minimal precautions
are required</li>
<li>if the activity remaining in the patient after treatment is
less than 1,100 MBq and the approximate radiation dose rate at 2 m
is less than 16 µSv/h, precautions should be taken whether the
patient is hospitalized or released</li>
<li>if the activity remaining in the patient after treatment is
greater than 1,100 MBq and the approximate radiation dose rate at 2
m exceeds 16 µSv/h, the patient should be isolated in the hospital
and strict precautions implemented to limit the exposure of other
persons</li>
</ul>
<p><em>E.2.5</em> <em><strong>Assignment of nuclear medicine
therapy rooms:</strong></em></p>
<p>Append the procedures used to assure that patients undergoing
nuclear therapy with Iodine-131 will be assigned to a specifically
designated private room with a private washroom. Typically, access
to such rooms should be restricted, the flooring should be sealed
against contamination and easy to decontaminate, and radiation
warning signs and the name of an emergency contact person should be
clearfixly posted.</p>
<p>The radiation dose rate in an occupied area adjacent to a room
occupied by a patient who is undergoing or who has undergone
radiation therapy must not exceed regulatory limits and a patient
who has not received nuclear therapy should not receive a radiation
dose in excess of 500 µSv during a hospital stay.</p>
<p><em>E.2.6</em> <em><strong>Decontamination and reuse of
treatment rooms:</strong></em></p>
<p>Append the procedures for returning rooms that have been used
for nuclear medicine therapy to a condition where they can be
safely released for other purposes.</p>
<p>Any licence issued by the CNSC in response to an application for
a licence to conduct nuclear medicine therapy will include
decontamination limits that must be met before nuclear medicine
therapy treatment rooms can be released. Accordingly, the
applicant’s proposed procedures and criteria for decontaminating
rooms used for nuclear medicine therapy should assure compliance
with the anticipated licence limits. For Class A, B and C nuclear
substances (referred to in Appendix&nbsp;Y: Classes of Nuclear
Substances), the relevant surface contamination limits, expressed
in terms of removable surface contamination averaged over an area
not exceeding 100 cm2, are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>0.3 Bq/cm<sup>2</sup> for all Class A nuclear substances, which
are typically relatively long-lived and emit alpha radiation</li>
<li>3 Bq/cm<sup>2</sup> for all Class B nuclear substances, which
are typically relatively long-lived and emit beta or gamma
radiation</li>
<li>30 Bq/cm<sup>2</sup> for all Class C nuclear substances, which
are typically short-lived and emit beta or gamma radiation</li>
</ul>
<p>See Appendix&nbsp;BB: Radioisotope Safety – Monitoring for
Radioactive Contamination for additional guidance for the creation
of the procedures to be appended.</p>
<p><em>E.2.7</em> <em><strong>Medical
emergencies:</strong></em></p>
<p>Provide a copy of the proposed policy and procedures for dealing
with medical emergencies that involve patients treated with nuclear
substances during the activities to be licensed. Include basic
procedures that address requirements for emergency surgery, the
death of a therapy patient, the availability of emergency supplies
and the role of the RSO or RSO’s delegate.</p>
<p>As noted in E.2.1, the licensee must have procedures for the
care and management of patients who are deceased following internal
administration or implantation of therapeutic nuclear substances,
including policies for cremation or other disposition of the
body.</p>
<p>The CNSC recommends that the above procedures include a “first
response” provision to make emergency care workers aware of the
nature of the emergency and the associated radiation hazards,
without restricting them from performing their health care duties.
Applicants should provide for the availability of basic cleaning
and decontamination supplies to use for radioactive spills,
including bodily fluids, and for the availability of radiation
safety experts to provide advice during the emergency.</p>

(use-types 880, 881, 883, 886, 888, 889, 895, 896, 897, 898, 899,
900, 901, 902, 907, 919, 940)</h3>
<p>This section is to be completed instead of Part C and Part D of
the application for low-risk use-types.</p>
<p>Radiation safety program:</p>
<p>In this part of the application, information is requested about
various aspects of the applicant’s radiation safety program. This
includes the organization management structure and details about
the workers who implement and supervise the program, as well as
workers who handle packages containing nuclear substances, the
radiation dose monitoring program and nuclear substance
inventory.</p>
<p>The radiation safety program components described in this guide
do not prevent alternative proposals being made by the applicants
to the CNSC but any proposed radiation safety program should
appropriately reflect the complexities and hazards of the
activities described in a licensee’s application. In addition, as
the licensee is ultimately responsible for radiation safety related
to all activities authorized by the licence, an effective radiation
safety program must have the support, commitment and participation
of management and staff.</p>
<p><em>E.6.1 <strong>Radiation safety officer:</strong></em></p>
<p>The RSO is the person responsible for the management and control
of the licensed activity and of the nuclear substances. The RSO is
the person the CNSC will contact about radiation safety and
compliance matters. The RSO must be familiar with the routine uses
of the nuclear substances described in the application, and must
know who is using them and where they are being used. The RSO must
be designated by the Applicant Authority.</p>
<p>Regulations require that the licensee notify the CNSC within 15
days of a change in RSO or in the RSO position.</p>
<p><em>E.6.2</em> <em><strong>RSO
acknowledgement:</strong></em></p>
<p>Once an individual has been designated as the RSO by the
Applicant Authority, the individual identified as RSO must sign a
consent form acknowledging his/her willingness to be designated as
the applicant’s RSO and accepting the responsibilities described in
the job description submitted.</p>
<p><em>E.6.3</em> <em><strong>Sealed source or radiation device
incidents (for renewal):</strong></em></p>
<p>Append a brief description of any occurrence or incident in the
previous licensing period that required investigation, as well as
any remedial action that was needed to prevent recurrence. Please
note that incidents must be reported immediately to the CNSC and
not just in the renewal application.</p>
<p>Briefly summarize the nature and significance of each. If an
incident has been previously reported to the CNSC (as required by
the NSCA and its regulations), simply reference the correspondence
for the original submission.</p>
<p><em>E.6.4</em> <em><strong>Access control and
security:</strong></em></p>
<p>Mark the relevant box indicating how access to the radiation
device or sealed source is to be controlled. More than one box can
be marked.</p>
<p>Access can be controlled by a lock, security guard or alarm
system. If something other than these methods is used, indicate on
the application that another method will be used and append a brief
description of the method.</p>
<p><em>E.6.5</em> <strong><em>Leak testing:</em></strong></p>
<p>All sealed sources (alone or in radiation devices) that contain
nuclear material in a quantity greater than 50 MBq must be leak
tested.</p>
<p>Indicate whether or not leak testing is required and describe
how the leak testing will be conducted in accordance with the
CNSC’s expectations included as Appendix&nbsp;AA: Regulatory
Expectations for Leak Testing of Sealed Sources of this
document.</p>
<p>Leak tests are not required where the sealed source contains a
gaseous nuclear substance; where the sealed source is contained in
a static eliminator in possession of the licensee for less than 15
months or are otherwise exempted by the <em>Nuclear Substances and
Radiation Devices Regulations</em>. Therefore, if the proposed
sealed sources do not require leak testing, indicate this on the
application form.</p>
<p><em>E.6.6</em> <strong><em>Emergency
procedures:</em></strong></p>
<p>Indicate if whether or not the emergency procedures outlined on
the application form will be adopted or other emergency procedures
will be developed.</p>
<p>If other emergency procedures will be developed, append a brief

<h3>E.7 Veterinary nuclear medicine (use-type 915)</h3>
<p><em>E.7.1</em> <em><strong>Veterinary
procedures:</strong></em></p>
<p>Append the procedures used to administer nuclear substances to
animals for diagnosis or treatment.</p>
<p>For each procedure, include the quantity and type of
radiopharmaceutical that is to be administered as well as the
number of administrations you are able to handle
simultaneously.</p>
<p><em>E.7.2</em> <strong><em>Animal housing:</em></strong></p>
<p>Append the policy and procedures regarding the housing controls
imposed on animals undergoing veterinary nuclear medicine.</p>
<p>An animal treated with radiopharmaceuticals must be quarantined
appropriately in a room specifically designated for treated
animals. In addition:</p>
<ul>
<li>cages housing animals treated with radionuclides must be posted
with a radiation warning sign</li>
<li>the dose rate in occupied or public access areas adjacent to
the animal housing must not exceed the regulatory limits and the
licensee should be able to demonstrate that it will not increase a
person’s effective dose by 500 µSv or more per year in excess of
background radiation.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>E.7.3</em> <strong><em>Disposal of animal
waste:</em></strong></p>
<p>Append the policy and procedures regarding the management of
waste arising from veterinary nuclear medicine.</p>
<p>For animal waste or emesis, report any method of release and
indicate the quantities released to municipal garbage systems,
municipal sewers, the atmosphere and other destinations. If a
nuclear substance has been transferred to another licensee, submit
that licensee’s name, complete address and licence number. For
short-lived radionuclides, it is advisable to store the waste for
decay and then dispose of the material.</p>
<p>The management of animal waste must include policy and
procedures for disposition of any carcasses containing nuclear
substances. Particular attention should be paid to the management
of recently deceased pets and the information provided to owners
regarding care and control of the animal, including restrictions on
burial or cremation.</p>
<p><em>E.7.4</em> <em><strong>Animals treated with
Iodine-131:</strong></em></p>
<p>Cages occupied by animals treated with Iodine-131 should be
lined with plastic and the bedding should be changed daily. Waste
contaminated with Iodine-131 should be stored in a well-shielded
and ventilated area until its disposal.</p>
<p>Append the policy and procedures for housing and waste disposal
for animals treated with Iodine-131.</p>
<p><em>E.7.5</em> <strong><em>Animals injected with
Technetium-99m:</em></strong></p>
<p>Technetium-99m has a half-life of six hours. The <em>General
Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations</em> prescribe that measures
to reduce the level of contamination in a place may be taken by a
licensee in a manner appropriate for the circumstances and in
accordance with the NSCA. In this case, it may be more reasonable
from an ALARA perspective to secure the area and let the
radioisotope decay to minimal levels. Therefore, before the
decontamination process is started, a licensee may secure an area
contaminated with Technetium-99m for 48 hours; this should allow
this radiopharmaceutical to decay to background radiation
(depending on what level of activity the radiopharmaceutical
started out with).</p>
<p>Append the policy and procedures used when dealing with animals
that have been injected with Technetium-99m.</p>
<p><em>E.7.6</em> <strong><em>Monitoring and release of animal
housing:</em></strong></p>
<p>Append the policy and procedures that confirm that the housing
for animals treated with veterinary nuclear medicine will not be
used for any other purpose until the level of radioactive
contamination meets criteria for release or re-use.</p>
<p>All areas of animal housing should be monitored, cleaned,
decontaminated and decommissioned, if necessary, before being
reoccupied. Access to the area is restricted until the area has
been decommissioned.</p>
<p>If the subsequent animal occupying the housing is undergoing
treatment with radiopharmaceuticals, the housing should meet the
contamination monitoring limits for work surfaces. If the housing
is released for non-radioactive use or if the housing is to be
subsequently occupied by an animal not subject to related diagnosis
or receiving radioactive therapy, the housing must meet the
decommissioning requirements specified in the licence.</p>
<p>The radioactive contamination level must be reduced sufficiently
so that it will not increase a person's effective dose by 500 µSv
or more per year in excess of background radiation.</p>
<p><em>E.7.7</em> <strong><em>Release of animals:</em></strong></p>
<p>Append the criteria used by the applicant to decide when animals
treated with radiopharmaceuticals will be released to their
owners.</p>
<p>In the case of cats treated for hyperthyroidism with Iodine-131,
the cat should remain quarantined until the dose rate does not
exceed 10 μSv/h, when measured at 30 cm from the cat’s thyroid
gland.</p>
<p>Every animal treated with diagnostic amounts of Technetium-99m
should remain in the veterinarian facilities until the dose rate
from the animal does not exceed 5.0 µSv/h on contact.</p>
<p>For any animal treatment, please provide calculations, including
all assumptions, which verify that the highest accumulated
radiation dose to a member of the public will not exceed 50 μSv as
a result of the nuclear substance remaining in the animal at the
time of release.</p>
<p><em>E.7.8</em> <strong><em>Treatment consent
form:</em></strong></p>
<p>Append a copy of the consent form that will be signed by the
owner before the animal is treated with radionuclides. Prior to
treating an animal with a radionuclide, the animal owner must be
informed of the study or treatment and sign a form consenting to
the study or treatment.</p>
<p>For animals treated with Iodine-131, include a copy of the
instruction sheet that will be given to the owner before the animal
is released. The owner must also be informed of the radiation risks
associated with the treatment and be given instructions on
minimizing the risks to persons caring or coming into contact with
the treated animal after its release from the facility.</p>
<p>Information should be provided regarding the potential for the
death of a treated animal and specific information provided to
owners regarding care and control of the animal, including
restrictions on burial or cremation.</p>
<h3>E.8 Fixed gauges (use-type 814)</h3>
<p><em>E.8.1</em> <strong><em>Procedures:</em></strong></p>
<p>Append the policy and procedures that detail the handling of
fixed gauges. Procedures must include the proposed inspection
program for the equipment and systems that will be used to carry on
the activity to be licensed.</p>
<p><em>E.8.2</em> <strong><em>Rules for entry into vessels or
hoppers:</em></strong></p>
<p>Append the policy and procedures to enter vessels or hoppers
fitted with fixed gauges.</p>
<p>If the applicant does not have vessels or hoppers equipped with
fixed gauges, provide a statement to that effect.</p>
<p>To minimize the possibility of inadvertent exposure, procedures
for entry into a vessel or hopper fitted with a radiation device
must be documented and provided to workers and any other person(s)
who may be required to enter the space.</p>
<p>Vessel entry procedures must include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>prior to any entry, every radiation device on or in the vessel
or hopper :
<ul>
<li>must be identified</li>
<li>have its source shielded or otherwise made safe</li>
<li>have been verified to be safe for a person to enter</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a radiation survey meter must be used to verify that it is safe
to enter the vessel or hopper, and to measure the radiation dose
values where any person will be located inside the vessel or
hopper, and these values must be recorded</li>
<li>a specific written authorization for entry into the vessel or
hopper must be issued for the proposed activity including the date
and estimated duration of entry</li>
<li>any person entering the vessel or hopper:
<ul>
<li>must be appropriately trained</li>
<li>be aware of the presence of the radiation devices</li>
<li>has been made aware of the specific written authorization</li>
<li>made aware of the recorded radiation dose values inside the
vessel or hopper where a person may be located</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a record must be maintained of the entry authorized including
the name of the person(s) entering the vessel or hopper and the
dose received by that person (s) as well as the results of any
other radiation survey</li>
</ul>
<p><em>E.8.3</em> <em><strong>Installation and dismounting of fixed
gauges:</strong></em></p>
<p>Append the policy and procedures for installing and/or
dismounting fixed gauges. If the applicant does not intend to
install or dismount gauges, provide a statement to that effect.</p>
<p>Documented procedures are required. Specific controls include
the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>installation is to be conducted only by workers who have
successfully completed appropriate training (a licence application
should include details on training in radiation detection
instruments and fixed gauge installation)</li>
<li>workers must be properly authorized to perform this
function</li>
<li>when installing a fixed gauge, the shutter of the device is to
be closed and padlocked before any work begins; the closed status
of the shutter is to be verified by noting the appropriate decrease
in the gamma survey meter reading</li>
<li>a safe work permit is to be obtained as authorization to
install or dismount fixed gauges</li>
<li>a calibrated survey meter is to be available at all times
during the operation</li>
<li>the source holder is to be locked in the off position during
mounting/dismounting operations</li>
<li>radiation intensities around the gauge are to be measured and
recorded with the shutter in both the open and closed position,
using at least four compass points on two perpendicular planes at
the external surfaces and at 30 cm from the external surface</li>
<li>occupancy evaluation is to be conducted to decide whether
additional shielding and/or personnel monitoring is required</li>
<li>permanent radiation warning signs are to be posted immediately
upon completion of the gauge installation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>E.8.4</em> <strong><em>Operation of insertion-type fixed
gauges:</em></strong></p>
<p>Append the policy and procedures to handle insertion-type fixed
gauges. If the applicant does not have insertion-type fixed gauges,
provide a statement to that effect.</p>
<p>To minimize the possibility of inadvertent and unnecessary
exposure, procedures must be documented and provided to maintenance
workers and others of the gauge’s isolation requirements. Specific
controls are required.</p>
<p>For the protection of workers, most nuclear gauging devices are
designed with built-in safety features. However, there is a type of
fixed gauge that is typically mounted on the outside of a vessel
and is connected through a well in that vessel. This type of fixed
gauge does not provide the same degree of safety as a standard
fixed gauge.</p>
<p>The operation of this type of fixed gauge requires that the
source be taken out of its source holder and positioned at a
specific location in the well. At this point, the amount of
shielding between the source holder and the inside of the vessel is
minimal. Therefore, insertion of the source into the well is to be
done as rapidly as possible to minimize exposure to workers. There
may also be a radiation hazard if the source is extended into the
well and the vessel is not full. Personnel monitoring of radiation
dose rates may be required during this type of installation.</p>
<p><em>E.8.5</em> <strong><em>Emergency procedures for fixed
gauges:</em></strong></p>
<p>In addition to the information provided in section D.14, append
procedures specific to dealing with fire including appropriate
actions to be taken and process to be followed for handling the
situation and reporting requirements.</p>
<p>As part of meeting the requirements under paragraph
4(<em>a</em>) of the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em>,
applicants must have available at the site of the licensed activity
a survey meter to be used for emergency events involving the fixed
gauges, particularly fires involving the nuclear gauges. Where the
applicant has not purchased a survey meter to remain on-site, the
applicant may satisfy the requirements by having a calibrated
survey meter at the site of licensed activity within four hours of
notification. The applicant may have a contract with a service
provider who can provide a calibrated survey meter at the site of
licensed activity within four hours of notification. The applicant
must supply a copy of such a contract showing this capability and
the contract must be valid for the proposed period of the licence
under consideration.</p>

<p><em>E.9.1 <strong>Releases of nuclear substances to the
environment:</strong></em></p>
<p>Append the policy for monitoring releases of nuclear substances
into the environment.</p>
<p>During assessment of the licence application, if it is
determined that the proposed/potential releases are substantial the
licensing specialist may contact the applicant to discuss the
potential requirement for an Environmental Assessment (EA).</p>
<p>Emissions of nuclear substances into the environment may be
subject to specific requirements of the <em>Canadian Environmental
Assessment Act</em> (CEAA) and its regulations. Considerations
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the potential for negative environmental effects</li>
<li>the impacts of the adverse environmental effects</li>

<li>maintaining a list of the licensee’s emergency equipment and an
emergency contact list</li>
<li>notifying the CNSC</li>
</ul>
<p><em>E.9.3</em> <strong><em>Abandonment of sealed
sources:</em></strong></p>
<p>In certain cases, the best option is to abandon a logging tool
with a nuclear sealed source. If so, the licensee is required to
abandon a nuclear substance or radiation devices in accordance with
section 4 of the <em>General Nuclear Safety and Control
Regulations</em>. Each notification of proposed abandonment must
include the:</p>

<h2 id="app-c">Appendix C: Qualifications and Duties of the
Radiation Safety Officer</h2>
<p>Radiation Safety Officers (RSOs) are specialists who, typically,
provide day-to-day administration and control of radiation safety
programs on behalf of their employers. Thus, the necessary
competence in terms of educational training and practical
experience that is required of an RSO in a particular situation
will vary according to the responsibilities assigned to the RSO and
the magnitude, complexity or diversity of the employer’s use of
nuclear substances. Competence in radiation safety matters may be
gained by completion of classroom instruction in radiation safety,
relevant work experience or any appropriate combination of formal
training and practical experience.</p>
<p>Typically, RSOs who are assigned lead responsibility to ensure
radiation safety should have relevant, practical work experience.
RSOs that handle packages containing open-source radioisotopes
should understand methods and technology to control, use, handle,
store and transfer the nuclear substances, and to monitor and
control radioactive contamination, radiation fields and radiation
exposures. They should also understand pertinent regulatory
processes and legislation. These may include the licensing process;
conditions of the licences issued to the licensee by the CNSC, the
<em>Nuclear Safety and Control Act</em> and its regulations; and
pertinent CNSC regulatory guidance documents.</p>
<p>Licensees are reminded that pursuant to section 15 of the
<em>General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations</em> that the
CNSC must be notified within 15 days of any change of RSO or the
RSO’s contact information.</p>
<p>To ensure radiation safety and compliance with regulatory
requirements on behalf of management, the RSO may need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>monitor, advise and consult regarding issues related to the
handling of nuclear substances and radiation devices in accordance
with regulations and licence conditions. Communicate with all
workers and management</li>
<li>review requests for authorization to purchase or use nuclear
substances and radiation devices in order to ensure that the
radioactive material, the proposed handling and location of storage
are acceptable and comply with the regulations and licence
requirements</li>
<li>assess the qualifications and competence of workers who will
use nuclear substances and radiation devices to determine whether
they can do so safely and in compliance with regulations and the
licence</li>
<li>ensure that workers who are required to use nuclear substances
and radiation devices are adequately trained in radiation safety
and radiation protection procedures. Authorize qualified workers to
use nuclear substances or operate radiation devices. Ensure that
workers whose duties may occasionally expose them to nuclear
substances and radiation devices, such as cleaners, administration
or other support staff, receive appropriate training in radiation
safety</li>
<li>designate workers as Nuclear Energy Workers in accordance with
the regulations</li>
<li>develop and implement programs to inspect and review licensed
activities; locations of nuclear substance and radiation device
storage; and the adequacy of worker training, safety procedures or
the work environment. Implement remedial actions to correct any
deficiencies identified</li>
<li>initiate any revisions to procedures, changes to
equipment/facilities and licence amendments required to ensure on
an ongoing basis that the licensee’s operations, equipment and
facilities comply with regulatory requirements</li>
<li>design and implement, in accordance with regulatory
requirements, appropriate personnel monitoring programs</li>
<li>administer or control the distribution, use, and maintenance of
personnel radiation monitoring devices and equipment, and the
recording of results</li>
<li>monitor the occupational radiation exposures received by
workers by reviewing the records of exposures. Recommend measures
to management to reduce these exposures in accordance with the
ALARA principle of dose limitation</li>
<li>investigate all reports of overexposures to ionizing radiation
and of accidents and losses involving nuclear substances and
radiation devices, determine pertinent facts or confirm events, and
recommend appropriate actions to mitigate the consequences or to
prevent recurrences. Ensure that the incidents and the results of
related investigations are reported to the CNSC and other relevant
authorities in accordance with the regulations and licence
conditions</li>
<li>assess the adequacy of survey programs that measure or control
radiation fields and radioactive contamination during licensed
activities</li>
<li>ensure that sealed sources are leak tested and
radiation-monitoring instruments are calibrated in accordance with
the regulatory requirements</li>
<li>coordinate or participate in emergency responses to accidents
and incidents involving nuclear substances and radiation
devices</li>
<li>ensure that all records and reports that are required by the
conditions of the licence and the regulations are prepared,

<h2 id="app-g">Appendix G: Principles for Applying ALARA to
Industrial Radiography</h2>
<ol>
<li>Ensure radiography locations are posted with radiation warning
signs or barriers to ensure compliance with dose-rate restrictions
in your licence and the CNSC regulations.</li>
<li>Post signs at boundaries to inform others of radiography in
progress. Ensure that all unauthorized personnel are out of the
radiography area prior to commencing and maintain careful
surveillance of the restricted area to ensure no other unauthorized
personnel enter the area.</li>
<li>Utilize tungsten collimators wherever possible or where
applicable. Collimators should be positioned in such a manner so
that the beam of radiation is directed away from personnel.</li>
<li>Source guide tubes should be positioned when possible to take
advantage of any shielding offered by surrounding components.</li>
<li>Radiography personnel shall position themselves as far as
possible from the exposed source. The distance shall be governed by
the radiographer’s ability to maintain surveillance over the high
radiation area.</li>
<li>Radiography personnel shall make use of any available shielding
offered by the surrounding work environment. Maintain surveillance
over the high radiation area.</li>
<li>The source should be exposed and retracted as quickly possible
without exerting excessive force on the exposure device.</li>
<li>Radiographers shall always approach the exposure device from
the rear with the radiation survey instrument in front of them.
Survey shall be made 360 degrees around the device and 100 percent
of the guide tube.</li>
<li>Report all deviations from good ALARA practices to the RSO or
other management immediately.</li>
<li>RSO or supervisor performs periodic in-field observations to
ensure ALARA practices are being implemented. These surveillances
should be documented.</li>
<li>Radiography operation staffing should include two operators, if
possible. More than two may be needed to control the boundaries to
achieve ALARA commitments.</li>
<li>Radiography personnel shall understand their responsibilities
and actions following a radiation incident to receive minimum
exposure and prevent overexposures during emergency
situations.</li>

<h2 id="app-i">Appendix I: Instructions for the Preparation of an
Emergency and Operating Procedures Manual</h2>
<p>This appendix is meant to assist new applicants in preparing
their emergency and operating procedures (EOP) manual. An EOP
manual must be submitted with an application for a nuclear
substance and radiation devices licence for industrial radiography.
Appendices G, H and J through P of this guide, inclusive, are
intended as operational guidance and may be included in your EOP.
The recommendations, suggestions and comments presented here are
the results of the CNSC’s review of various manuals and do not
necessarily represent all the material required in an EOP manual.
The information requested is considered as the minimum information
required for an EOP manual. As an applicant or licensee, you are
encouraged to include any additional information that you deem
necessary for the safe use of nuclear substances in your
operations.</p>
<p>The EOP manual should note the date it was prepared (or
revised), who prepared it and what equipment it covers. It should
include in its introduction a list of supporting documentation to
be included in its appendices (e.g., checklists, manufacturer's
manuals).</p>
<p>Material covered in the EOP should be divided into two sections:
daily (or routine) operations and emergency procedures, both of
which are required by the Nuclear Safety and Control Act and its
regulations.</p>
<h3>I.1 Daily (routine) operations</h3>
<p>This section should be supported by the manufacturer's operating
instructions and the various checklists that would be used for
day-to-day operations. These operations should be described in the
chronological order in which they would occur, beginning with the
collection of equipment at the shop and ending with the return of
the equipment and submission of the required reports.</p>
<p>The procedures should cover any operations required for a
radiography job that lasts one day or longer, and must take into
consideration the different operating processes of the types of
exposure devices to be covered by this manual.</p>
<p>These procedures would include equipment and document checks,
preparation for shipment and daily inspection of equipment.</p>
<p>An example of a daily checklist can be found in Appendix&nbsp;J:
Daily Checklist (Example).</p>
<p>Subsections of the daily operations manual should include:</p>
<h4>I.1.1 Exposure devices:</h4>
<p>These must be labelled as required by regulations. The operator
would have to ensure he/she has the corresponding operations
manual. These items should be included in the daily operations
checklist.</p>
<h4>I.1.2 Radiation survey meters:</h4>
<p>For purposes of this manual, operators should be instructed to
check batteries and calibration (calibration sticker). Survey meter
function can be checked while performing the surface dose-rate
survey of the exposure device. These items should be included in
the daily operations checklist.</p>
<h4>I.1.3 Dose control:</h4>
<p>A dose-control program must be documented and must be designed
to prevent exposures that exceed the permissible limits. The
program must therefore address dose and time factors and must also
take into consideration the delays associated with TLD
analysis.</p>
<p>Action levels must be established, implemented and enforced by
the licensee.</p>
<h4>I.1.4 Safety equipment:</h4>
<p>All required safety equipment should be listed in the daily
operations checklist.</p>
<h4>I.1.5 Transportation of sources:</h4>
<p>Preparation of the exposure device (i.e., the transport package)
and documents for transport must be described. These steps apply to
all shipment/transport of nuclear substances, whether it is by
private vehicle, company vehicle or commercial shipper. A checklist
for packaging and transportation should be prepared.</p>
<p>In addition, an appropriate package of documents must be
prepared as described in the TDGR or as directed by the equivalent
level of safety permit. These documents must accompany the device
while it is being transported.</p>
<h4>I.1.6 Source-changing procedures:</h4>
<p>This part of operations requires that a source-change request
and consent form (see Appendix&nbsp;K: Source Change Request and
Consent Form (Example)) be completed and the work carried out only
by authorized personnel. Manufacturer's procedures must be
followed. After the new source has been inserted, a survey of the
exposure device must be completed and the results recorded.
Inventory sheets must be updated.</p>
<h4>I.1.7 Leak tests:</h4>
<p>Instruction on how to perform a leak test should be included in
this section. Leak tests must include analysis for the depleted
uranium incorporated in the shielding body, if any, as well as for
the nuclear substance source assembly.</p>
<h4>I.1.8 Source storage enclosures:</h4>
<p>Permanent storage locations should not be a part of this manual;
they are assessed as part of your initial licence application. The
preparation and use of temporary locations should be described
here. Instruction must be given on what to do should the storage
site be used for more than 90 days in any calendar year (i.e., the
CNSC must be notified to formalize the location as a long-term
place of storage and records must be maintained at that storage
location in accordance with the licence conditions).</p>
<h4>I.1.9 Records:</h4>
<p>This section should include instruction as to what forms and
records are to be completed and submitted by the operator. Samples
of records must be included in your manual and referenced in the
appropriate procedures. Following is a list of the various records
that must be kept. Each item in the list has been designated [EOP]
or [ADMIN] depending on whether they need to be kept in the EOP
manual or on file for administrative purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li>inventory, make, model number, serial number, the activity of
the nuclear substance, date of procurement and disposal of both the
sources and the exposure devices [ADMIN]. It is recommended that a
sheet be prepared for each exposure device. The header should list
device model number, serial number, location of storage and dates
of procurement and disposal. The columns on the sheet should record
the source information under headings for date of insertion, model
number, serial number, isotope, activity, date activity was
measured, date of removal, to whom the source was transferred and
who performed the transfer.</li>

<h4>I.1.10 Dosimeters:</h4>
<h4>I.1.10.1 Direct reading dosimeters:</h4>
<p>These are commonly referred to as DRDs. For purposes of this
manual, the operator should be instructed on:</p>
<ul>
<li>the purpose of the DRD</li>
<li>when it must be worn</li>
<li>where on the body it must be worn</li>
<li>when readings are to be recorded and submitted</li>
<li>what must be done when a reading exceeds 2.0 mSv</li>
<li>any other limit specified by the applicant</li>
</ul>
<h4>I.1.10.2 Thermoluminescent dosimetry:</h4>
<p>These are commonly referred to as TLDs. For purposes of this
manual, the operator should be instructed on:</p>
<ul>
<li>the purpose of the TLD</li>
<li>when it must be worn</li>
<li>where on the body it must be worn</li>
<li>when the TLD must be returned for reading</li>
<li>the fact that the TLD is to be worn by only one person</li>
<li>the fact that the TLD is only to be worn for the assigned
period</li>
<li>storing the TLD away from sources of radiation</li>
<li>reporting requirements for lost TLD</li>
<li>reporting requirements if TLD is accidentally exposed to
radiation while not being worn</li>
</ul>
<h4>I.1.11 Radiation survey meter:</h4>
<p>For purposes of this manual, the operator should be instructed
on:</p>
<ul>
<li>steps to take before use (battery and calibration checks)</li>
<li>the ‘function check’ (this can be done while surveying the
exposure device and observing that the survey meter is displaying
the expected radiation reading)</li>
<li>when the survey meter is to be used</li>
<li>what to do when the survey meter malfunctions or fails the
battery, calibration or function checks</li>
</ul>
<h4>I.1.12 Radiation audible alarms:</h4>
<p>For purposes of this manual, the operator should be instructed
on:</p>
<ul>
<li>who must wear an audible alarm</li>
<li>when to wear the dosimeter</li>
<li>where on the body to wear the dosimeter</li>
<li>any battery and function checks to be performed</li>
<li>that it is not be used as a substitute for the survey
meter</li>
<li>calibration requirements</li>
</ul>
<h4>I.1.13 Operations:</h4>
<p>The operations subsection of this manual should include the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a description of the procedures for securing and barricading of
the work area. It is recommended that a chart be prepared to be
used by the operator which would show the distances for the 0.1
mSv/h barrier, based on the activity of the source and collimator
to be used. Barrier placement must be confirmed with a survey meter
with the source in the exposure position</li>
<li>a description of the formula and procedure to be used to ensure
the doses described in the barrier area are not exceeded. To
properly determine dose, the survey meter must be carried to the
exposure device and the exposure device must be surveyed on all
sides.
<ul>
<li>the formula is DOSE = DOSE RATE X TIME (OCCUPANCY).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>steps to be taken to minimize exposure if the movement of
personnel cannot be controlled.</li>
<li>use of a radiation survey meter&nbsp; to establish barriers and
controlled areas to ensure the return of the source to the fully
shielded position after each retraction of the source and to
prepare the device for shipment</li>
</ul>
<h4>I.1.14 Radiographer training:</h4>
<p>Training of the operator by the licensee on the exposure device
to be used should be reviewed.</p>
<p>Transportation of dangerous goods training requirements should
be reviewed.</p>
<p>Training of the operator by the licensee on the specific
emergency procedures should be reviewed.</p>
<p>All certified exposure device operators who transport nuclear
substances, whether by company or private vehicle or a commercial
shipper, are required by the <em>Packaging and Transport of Nuclear
Substances Regulations, 2015</em> and the Transport Canada's
<em>Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations</em> (TDGR) to
hold a Training Certificate.</p>
<p>Sub-Section 6.1(1) of the TDGR requires that no person shall
handle, offer for transport or transport dangerous goods unless the
person is a trained person or performing those activities under the
direct supervision of a trained person. A trained person is defined
in section 6.2 as someone who has received adequate training
related to that person's assigned duties in the aspects of
handling, offering for transport or transporting dangerous goods,
and has been issued a Training Certificate for Class 7, Radioactive
Materials.</p>
<p>The training requirements for Class 7, Radioactive Materials
should include all elements listed in section 6.2 of the TDGR and
emergency response procedures for transportation incidents and
reporting of dangerous occurrences.</p>
<p>A certified exposure device operator (CEDO) is a person who has
successfully completed the CNSC’s certification program and is
recognized by the CNSC as a CEDO by the issuance of a certified
exposure device operator card. A CEDO may operate any type of
radiographic exposure device in Canada. Certified exposure device
operator cards, however, do not cover handling, offering for
transport or transporting a radiographic exposure device, and
therefore cannot be used as a training certificate for TDGR
purposes.</p>
<p>To complete the training requirements, a certificate of training
must be issued by the employer. The certificate of training is
valid for the period specified in the TDGR.</p>
<p>The following list summarizes the requirements of the TDGR that
relate to the offering for transport (and the transport itself) of
radioactive materials.</p>

<h4>I.1.15 Emergency procedures:</h4>
<p>There are two types of emergencies that must be addressed in
this part of the manual. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>situations that occur during radiographic operations
(“operational emergencies”)</li>
<li>those which occur during other phases (e.g., during transport,
fire, theft, leaking source)</li>
</ul>
<p>Source retrievals may only be undertaken by those persons
specifically trained.</p>
<h4>I.1.15.1 Operational Emergencies</h4>
<p>Responses to operational emergencies should be divided into
three parts:</p>
<p><strong>Pre-retrieval steps:</strong></p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>removal of all personnel from radiation area</li>
<li>resurvey area and move barriers (0.1 mSv/h) and establish
control areas</li>
<li>contact appropriate authorities</li>
<li>ensure proper dosimetry worn</li>
<li>description of how to locate source position using a survey
meter</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Specific retrieval steps:</strong></p>
<p>Once the source position is known a specific emergency procedure
may be followed. Specific emergency procedures should not repeat
the common pre-retrieval procedures. Some examples of emergency
situations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>loss or theft of source</li>
<li>fire</li>
<li>leaking source</li>
<li>transport (accident)</li>
</ul>
<p>The following emergency situations require specialized
training:</p>
<ul>
<li>cable drive exposure device emergencies</li>
<li>source disconnect</li>
<li>source misconnect</li>
<li>source jammed in guide tube</li>
<li>source jammed in collimator</li>
<li>source not fully retracted</li>
<li>source outside the exposure device</li>
<li>pneumatically operated exposure device emergencies</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Post-retrieval steps:</strong></p>
<p>These should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>reporting requirements for all agencies involved (CNSC,
Transport Canada, provincial authorities, etc.)</li>
<li>removal from service of all involved equipment</li>
<li>required equipment checks, leak tests, surveys, etc.</li>
<li>recording and reporting of all doses associated with the
retrieval</li>
<li>preparation of an incident report (a standard form should be
prepared)</li>
</ul>
<h4>I.1.15.2 Non-operational emergencies</h4>
<p><strong>Leaking sources:</strong></p>
<p>Dealing with sources leaking nuclear substance and/or
contamination problems is beyond the scope and training of a
certified exposure device operator.</p>
<p>If contamination is suspected the operator should contact the
RSO immediately.</p>
<p>Survey meters should not be used for contamination checks.</p>
<p><strong>Transport incidents:</strong></p>
<p>For exposure devices involved in transport accidents, procedures
must include directions on who to call (i.e. RSO, CNSC Duty
Officer, CANUTEC, etc.) and in what order in accordance with the
<em>Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations</em>.</p>
<p>The first instruction should be to attend to any injuries. If
possible, remove injured persons from radiation areas.</p>
<p>If the exposure device transport compartment is not damaged, it
is safe to assume the exposure device has not been damaged. A
survey should be performed as soon as possible to confirm this;
radiation barriers and control areas should then be
established.</p>
<p>If the transport compartment is damaged and a survey cannot be
performed, barriers should be set using the worse-case scenario of
the source being fully exposed.</p>
<p><strong>Sources involved in a fire:</strong></p>
<p>Firefighting personnel should be informed of the possible hazard
and its location and, when it is possible, monitor the radiation
dose rates.</p>
<p>After the fire, barricade the area, perform a detailed survey of
the exposure device and take the appropriate actions. Equipment
involved in the fire must not be used until it is leak tested and
proper operation is confirmed by persons authorized to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Lost source:</strong></p>
<p>The loss of a source must be immediately reported to the CNSC in
accordance with the <em>Nuclear Safety and Control Act and its
regulations</em>.</p>

<h2 id="app-z">Appendix Z: Regulatory Expectations for Calibration
of Survey Meters</h2>
<h3>Z.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>The CNSC regulations require radiation survey meters to be
calibrated, in order to assure persons using the survey meter that
the unit is functioning properly and that the readings obtained are
representative of the actual conditions.</p>
<p>This document outlines the CNSC’s expectations for applicants
and licensees to meet regulatory requirements with respect to the
calibration of survey meters.</p>
<p>Nothing in this document shall be construed to imply that the
CNSC authorizes, certifies or licences persons to conduct survey
meter calibrations. It is the responsibility of the licensee to
ensure that any person conducting a survey meter calibration on
their behalf can do so in accordance with CNSC regulatory
requirements and the expectations outlined in this document.</p>
<h3>Z.2 Regulatory Basis</h3>
<p>The regulatory requirement to have a calibrated survey meter is
specified in section 20 of the Nuclear Substances and Radiation
Devices Regulations and in sub-section 18(2) of the <em>Class II
Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment Regulations</em>:</p>
<p>“<em>No person shall use, for the purpose of the Act, the
regulations made under the Act or an order or a licence, a
radiation survey meter that has not been calibrated within the 12
months preceding its use.</em>”</p>
<h3>Z.3 Program Expectations for Calibration of Survey Meters</h3>
<p>In order to ensure that the requirements of the regulations are
met for having a survey meter that is calibrated, applicants and
licensees must verify that the calibration is carried out in
accordance with the following expectations.</p>
<h4>Z.3.1 Calibration Procedure Documentation</h4>
<p>Before calibrating any specific make and model of survey meter,
the person conducting the calibration shall have available for
inspection and assessment a documented calibration procedure
consisting of</p>
<ol class="list-lower-alpha">
<li>a general description of the method of calibration</li>
<li>an identification and proof of verification of uncertainties
associated with the jig, the source, attenuators, and decay
correction which are associated with the total uncertainty of the
calibration</li>
<li>step-by-step procedures, preferably including manufacturers'
manuals, to show that sufficient information about the survey meter
is available to operate, to perform pre-calibration checks and to
calibrate the specific survey meter</li>
</ol>
<h4>Z.3.2 Survey Meter Pre-Calibration Check</h4>
<p>Before calibration, each survey meter shall have a
pre-calibration check that consists of:</p>
<ol class="list-lower-alpha">
<li>a battery check to ensure a satisfactory voltage can be
maintained throughout the calibration</li>
<li>a verification of operating voltage</li>
<li>a comprehensive functional check on all ranges of the survey
meter</li>
</ol>
<h4>Z.3.3 Physical and Environmental Expectations for Jigs and
Survey Meters</h4>
<ol class="list-lower-alpha">
<li>The beam calibrator jig must be located in the following
manner:
<ol class="list-lower-roman">
<li>to minimize radiation scatter and be at least 1 m from the
floor, the ceiling, and from any wall. The distance between any
scattering object and the source must be at least 0.5 m</li>
<li>in an area free of interference from sources of ionizing
radiation other than the calibration source</li>
<li>in an area where electrostatic, electrical and magnetic fields
and other non-ionizing radiation, such as radio frequency and
microwave, will not affect instrument response</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The survey meter to be calibrated shall:
<ol class="list-lower-roman">
<li>be positioned on the jig to minimize bias due to geotropism,
directional dependence, and non-uniformity of the source radiation
beam across and through the detector volume</li>
<li>have any beta window or shield in the optimum position
(normally closed) for best (i.e. flattest) energy response</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The uncertainty in calibration distance shall not be greater
than 2% and shall be the arithmetic sum of the uncertainty of the
jig distance scale, the uncertainty in physical placement and
repositioning of the survey meter, the uncertainty in location of
the source centre when on the jig, and the uncertainty of the
centre of the sensitive volume of the survey meter detector</li>
<li>The survey meter to be calibrated shall have achieved
equilibrium with the temperature, pressure and humidity of the
local calibration area. These environmental parameters should be
noted and shall be within the approved range as specified by the
manufacturer of the survey meter. It is recommended that
instruments are calibrated at about 20°C (68°F) and 101.3 kPa (1
atmosphere), or at the anticipated operational parameters. It
should be noted that the response of some survey meters must be
corrected for temperature and pressure. Therefore, where required,
such corrections must be performed</li>
<li>The calibration should be carried out where the level of
background radiation is known and the appropriate corrections made
to compensate for the contribution from this potential source of
error. This is particularly important when measuring at the lowest
ranges on the survey meter</li>
</ol>
<h4>Z.3.4 Expectations for Calibration Sources</h4>
<p>It is preferable to use the same reference isotope as the
manufacturer for the calibration source, especially if the
manufacturer's specified energy response is to be assumed. Whatever
isotope is used, the energy dependence of the dose rate response of
the survey meter shall be known and shall be within 30% of the true
dose rate over the energy spectrum of interest.</p>
<p>The calibration source activity (or exposure rate) shall be
known to an uncertainty of not greater than ± 10%. This uncertainty
shall include attenuators (used singly or in combination), if they
are an integral part of the source assembly. A calibration source
certificate shall be available for inspection, and as a minimum the
source shall be implicitly traceable through a source supplier to a
national or international standard. The calibration source activity
shall be corrected for decay at a frequency to ensure its activity
is within 1 % of its true value.</p>
<h4>Z.3.5 Expectations for Survey Meter Calibration</h4>
<p>Each survey meter shall be calibrated up to its highest range or
the 10 mSv/h range, whichever is lower. The manufacturer's
recommended calibration method, if any, must be followed, and the
calibration shall be verified at about 20 to 25% and 75 to 80% of
the measurement of each range or decade.</p>
<p>Measurement shall be recorded before and after any necessary (or
preferred) calibration adjustments. A survey meter shall be
considered to meet the criteria for being adequately calibrated
when each observed measurement is within ±20% of the expected dose
rate.</p>
<p>Measurements above 10 mSv/h need not be calibrated, but each
range shall be checked to ensure response and, as far as
practicable, by decreasing calibration distance the appropriate
increasing dose rate response shall be checked.</p>
<h4>Z.3.6 Expectations for Record Completion</h4>
<p>Immediately following calibration the person completing the
calibration must complete a calibration certificate, and complete
and affix a durable calibration sticker, bearing the date of
calibration, to the survey meter. The person conducting the
calibration shall return the original certificate with the survey
meter to the user.</p>
<p>If a survey meter fails to meet the criteria for being
adequately calibrated, the person conducting the calibration shall
immediately notify the person who requested the calibration.</p>
<p>If requested to do so, a person conducting the calibration may,
if they are qualified through training or other certification,
repair a survey meter before returning to the user. Subsequent to
any repair which exceeds the manufacturer’s instructions for normal
maintenance, a survey meter shall be recalibrated.</p>
<h4>Z.3.7 Documentation of Calibration</h4>
<p>In order to meet the requirements of Section 20 of the Nuclear
Substances and <em>Radiation Devices Regulations</em>, licensees
must make available on request to the CNSC a document for each
survey meter which includes the following information:</p>
<ol class="list-lower-alpha">
<li>licensee name and CNSC Licence Number</li>
<li>survey meter make and model, including serial number of the
detector unit and the probe used in the calibration, if
appropriate</li>
<li>the calibration source used, including isotope and
activity</li>
<li>the results of the pre-calibration checks, including:
<ol class="list-lower-roman">
<li>battery condition</li>
<li>operating voltage</li>
<li>temperature, pressure and humidity, at the time of
calibration</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>for each range calibrated
<ol class="list-lower-roman">
<li>the range on the survey meter that was calibrated</li>
<li>the expected dose rate using the calibration device</li>
<li>the observed dose rate on the survey meter, with units,
including both pre and post calibration</li>
<li>the calculated percent variance of the observed dose rate
versus expected dose rate</li>
<li>any notes of concerns or anomalies for that range</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>any notes of anomalies or problems associated with the
calibration of the survey meter in general</li>
<li>the date of the calibration of the survey meter</li>
<li>the name and signature of the person who conducted the
calibration</li>
<li>acknowledgement that the calibration was carried out in
accordance with these requirements</li>
</ol>
<h3>Z.4 Maintenance of Records</h3>
<p>The licensee shall retain a record of each survey meter
calibration as required by the NSCA and regulations and shall
retain those records for the period specified in the licence or the
Regulations, as appropriate.</p>

<h2 id="app-aa">Appendix AA: Regulatory Expectations for Leak
Testing of Sealed Sources</h2>
<h3>AA.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>Leak testing of sealed sources is required under CNSC
regulations to ensure that a sealed source has not developed
defects, has been damaged or has degraded so as to present an
unrecognized radiological risk to persons using or working near the
source.</p>
<p>This document outlines the CNSC’s expectations for applicants
and licensees to meet the regulatory requirements for leak testing
of sealed sources.</p>
<p>Nothing in this document should be construed to imply that the
CNSC authorizes, certifies or licences persons to leak test sealed
sources. It is the responsibility of the licensee to ensure that
any person conducting a leak test of a sealed source on their
behalf can do so in accordance with these expectations.</p>
<h3>AA.2 Regulatory Basis</h3>
<p>The regulatory requirement to conduct regular leak testing of
sealed sources, including their frequency and detection level, is
specified in section 18 of the <em>Nuclear Substances and Radiation
Devices Regulations</em> and in section 19 of the <em>Class II
Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment Regulations</em>:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet-none">
<li><em>“(1) Every licensee who possesses, uses or produces either
a sealed source containing 50 MBq or more of a nuclear substance or
a nuclear substance as shielding shall, at the following times,
conduct leak tests on the sealed source or shielding using
instruments and procedures that enable the licensee to detect a
leakage of 200 Bq or less of the nuclear substance:</em>
<ul class="list-bullet-none">
<li><em>(a) where the sealed source or shielding is used after
being stored for 12 or more consecutive months, immediately before
using it;</em></li>
<li><em>(b) where the sealed source or shielding is being stored,

<h2 id="app-bb">Appendix BB: Radioisotope Safety – Monitoring for
Radioactive Contamination</h2>
<h3>BB.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>This document provides general guidance for monitoring and
controlling radioactive contamination, and relating the monitoring
results to the CNSC radioisotope licence criteria. This document
pertains primarily to laboratories, but also applies to the control
of radioactive contamination in other locations. The document also
provides guidance on contamination monitoring instrument
selection.<br /></p>
<p>Each CNSC radioisotope licence authorising the use of open
source radioactive material contains a condition which states the
regulatory criteria pertaining to radioactive contamination. This
licence condition can be found in section BB.7.</p>
<p>The specified contamination criteria must be applied to all
areas where radioisotopes are used. Notwithstanding these limits,
licensees should maintain levels of radioactive contamination as
low as reasonably achievable (ALARA).</p>
<h3>BB.2 Elements of a Contamination Monitoring Program</h3>
<h4>BB.2.1 Method of measurement</h4>
<p>Radioactive contamination may be measured directly or
indirectly. Direct measurement means the use of portable radiation
detection instruments to detect both fixed and removable
contamination. Direct measurement may be used when background
radiation levels are negligible compared to licence criteria.
Indirect measurement only detects removable contamination by means
of wipe tests.</p>
<h4>BB.2.2 Instrument selection</h4>
<p>The ability of various radiation instruments to detect
radioisotopes of interest will vary with the instrument and the
manufacturer. Guidance on the selection of instruments can be found
in section BB.8. For specific information on a particular make or
model, contact the manufacturer.</p>
<h4>BB.2.3 Locations of measurement</h4>
<p>The locations that are to be monitored should be numbered on a
plan of the radioisotope work area. These locations should include
working surfaces, such as benches, countertops, fume hoods, etc.,
storage areas, and non-working surfaces such as floors, instruments
and equipment, door handles, light switches, sink taps and
telephone receivers. Several random locations should also be
monitored. Too rigid a set of locations may overlook problem
areas.</p>
<h4>BB.2.4 Instrument checks and calibration</h4>
<p>Non-portable instruments used for counting wipes, such as liquid
scintillation counters, well-crystal type gamma counters, gas-flow
proportional counters, semiconductor gamma spectrometers and gamma
cameras, should be routinely serviced according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep a record of the service
information and dates.</p>
<p>Before monitoring for contamination, portable instruments should
be given operational checks as specified by the manufacturer (i.e.
battery check, high-voltage check, response check, etc) and the
background radiation level should be measured. Record the
operational checks and background measurement. Similarly,
non-portable instruments used to count wipes should count and
record a blank and standard with each set of wipes.</p>
<p>Instruments that are not operating within the parameters of the
operational checks or which show anomalous background, blank or
standard measurements, should not be used until their proper
operation can be verified.</p>
<h4>BB.2.5 Frequency of monitoring</h4>
<p>Contamination monitoring frequencies must conform to the
requirements on the requirements indicated on the appropriate CNSC
Laboratory Rules Poster (Basic Level INFO-0728-1, Intermediate
Level INFO-0728-2, High Level INFO-0728-3 or Nuclear Medicine
INFO-0728-4), or in a radioisotope licence condition. Copies of the
CNSC Laboratory Posters can be found on the CNSC website or by
contacting the CNSC.</p>
<p>When radioactive material is not used for a prolonged period of
time, contamination monitoring is not required, but such a period
should be identified in the records.</p>
<h4>BB.2.6 Decontamination</h4>
<p>Any area that is found to have non-fixed contamination exceeding
the regulatory criteria must be cleaned and re-monitored. If the
area cannot be cleaned to meet the criteria, the contaminated
surface must be sealed, removed or shielded until the criteria are
met.</p>
<p>Note: For short-lived radionuclides, the room or area may be
posted and secured until the radioisotope decays.</p>
<h4>BB.2.7 Monitoring Records</h4>
<p>Contamination monitoring records must be kept for one year after
the expiry of the licence and must be available for inspection by
CNSC staff. These records should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>date of measurement</li>
<li>make and model of the instrument</li>
<li>monitoring locations</li>
<li>contamination monitoring results in Bq/cm2 (before and after
contamination)</li>
<li>for portable instruments, the results of operational checks and
background measurements</li>
<li>for non-portable instruments, blank and standard measurement
results</li>
<li>instrument calibration data should be recorded and updated as
necessary</li>
</ul>
<h3>BB.3 Direct Measurement of Contamination Using a Portable
Meter</h3>
<p>Depending upon the detector and the radioisotopes, direct
measurement is often convenient for monitoring large areas. Direct
measurement instrument readings include both fixed and non-fixed
contamination. Thus a reading which satisfies the licence criteria
gives a conservative estimate of non-fixed contamination.</p>
<ul>
<li>monitor the locations marked on the plan of the working area by
slowly passing the detector over each area</li>
<li>keep the detector face towards the surface being monitored and
keep the distance between the detector and the surface as small as
possible without touching (and possibly contaminating) the
detector</li>
<li>if contamination is detected, stop and obtain a measurement.
Clean the area until the instrument measurement is below the
licence criteria. A reading in excess of licence criteria after
repeated cleaning is an indication of fixed contamination or a high
radiation background</li>
<li>identify and mark the contaminated area on the plan</li>
<li>record the highest measurement for each area and the final
measurement after decontamination</li>
</ul>
<h3>BB.4 Indirect Measurement of Contamination with Wipes</h3>
<ul>
<li>wipe each of the locations shown on the plan of the working
area with a filter paper, wipe or cotton swab lightly moistened
with alcohol or water. Use one numbered wipe per location One
“screening” wipe can be used to monitor several locations. If
contamination is found, the contaminated area must be identified
and decontaminated</li>
<li>wipe an area of 100 cm2. Using uniform and constant pressure
ensure the area is wiped.</li>
<li>if necessary, carefully dry the wipe to prevent loss of
activity. Since the contamination may be absorbed into the wipe
material, the use of a wetting agent may lead to a significant
underestimate of alpha and low-energy beta contamination with some
counting methods</li>
<li>count the wipes in a low-background area and record all
results</li>
<li>if the wipes are to be counted on a contamination meter, the
wipe should be smaller than or equal to the sensitive area of the
detector</li>
<li>clean any contaminated areas and re-monitor. Record results
before and after decontamination.</li>
</ul>
<h4>BB.5 Relating Measurement Readings to Regulatory Criteria</h4>
<p>The readings from contamination meters and non-portable
instruments can be related to regulatory criteria if the efficiency
of the instrument for a specific radioisotope is known.</p>
<p>Instrument efficiencies for specific radioisotopes can be
obtained from the manufacturer or determined using an appropriate
standard of known activity. For a description of instrument
efficiency refer to the Detector Efficiency section below.</p>
<p>For mixtures of radioisotopes, do all the calculations using the
radioisotope for which the instrument has the lowest detection
efficiency.</p>
<p>Using the following equation, calculate the measurement results
in Bq/cm<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Potable contamination monitoring instruments must be capable of
making reproducible measurements at the licence criteria limits. A
minimum detection limit is approximately twice the background
measurement.</p>

averaged over an area not exceeding 100&nbsp;cm2</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>non-fixed contamination in all other areas does not exceed:
<ul>
<li>0.3 Bq/cm<sup>2</sup> for all Class A radionuclides</li>
<li>3 Bq/cm<sup>2</sup> for all Class B radionuclides</li>
<li>30 Bq/cm<sup>2</sup> for all Class C radionuclides; averaged

<p>Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>the principal energy quoted for the beta emitters is the
average beta energy</li>
<li>the (%) beside the gamma emitters is the percent abundance for
that energy</li>
<li>certain radioisotopes, such as Po-210 and Ra-226, are part of a
decay chain and can be detected by measuring for the decay
products. Ra-226 plus its daughters is an alpha, beta and gamma
emitter and can be efficiently detected using thin-window Geiger
detector, a well-crystal sodium iodide counter or a liquid
scintillation detector</li>
<li>some hand-held instruments may also be used to screen wipes if
used in low-background area</li>
</ul>
<h4>BB.9 Detector Efficiency</h4>
<p>The detector efficiency depends upon:</p>
<ul>
<li>the type of detector (GM, NaI Scintillation, Plastic
Scintillation, Proportional)</li>
<li>the detector size and shape</li>
<li>the distance from the detector to the radioactive material</li>
<li>the radioisotope and the type of radiation measured (alpha,
beta and gamma radiations and their energies)</li>
<li>the backscatter of radiation toward the detector</li>
<li>the absorption of the radiation before it reaches the detector
(by air and by the detector covering)</li>
</ul>
<p>The detector efficiency can be found by:</p>
<ol>
<li>counting the standard source of known activity with your
detector.<br />
Efficiency=(detector count rate - background count rate) / known
activity of standard source</li>
<li>asking the manufacturer about the efficiency of the detector
for your specific radioisotope(s)</li>

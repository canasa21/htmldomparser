<title>REGDOC-2.9.1: Environmental Protection: Environmental
Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>This regulatory document is part of the CNSC's environmental
protection series of regulatory documents. The full list of
regulatory document series is included at the end of this document
and can also be found on the <a href=
"http://nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/acts-and-regulations/regulatory-documents/">
CNSC's website</a>.</p>
<p>Environmental protection for nuclear facilities and activities
is done in accordance with the <em>Nuclear Safety and Control
Act</em> (NSCA) and the regulations made under it. The CNSC
requires the environmental effects of all nuclear facilities or
activities to be considered and evaluated when licensing decisions
are made.</p>
<p>This document will be used to assess licence applications for
proposed new nuclear facilities or activities, licence applications
for existing facilities or activities (renewals and amendments),
and environmental protection measures, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>all licence applications that demonstrate potential
interactions between the facility or activity and the environment
are subject to an environmental assessment (EA), either under the
NSCA or under the <em>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act,
2012</em> (CEAA 2012)</li>
<li>for each facility or activity that has direct interactions with
the environment, the applicant or licensee must demonstrate that
environmental protection measures are or will be in place</li>
<li>where an environmental risk assessment (ERA) is required for a
facility or activity (details are included in this regulatory
document):
<ul>
<li>the ERA is subject to regular updates (at least every five
years, and whenever a significant change occurs in either the
facility or activity that could alter the nature (type or
magnitude) of the interaction with the environment within the ERA
predictions)</li>
<li>the licensee's ERA informs an EA under CEAA 2012 and forms the
basis of an EA under the NSCA</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases, the EA (either under CEAA 2012 or under the NSCA),
the environmental protection measures and the ERA (where required)
are commensurate with the scale and complexity of the environmental
risks associated with the nuclear facility or activity.</p>
<p>This regulatory document describes:</p>
<ul>
<li>the CNSC's principles for environmental protection</li>
<li>for all nuclear facilities or activities that interact with the
environment, the scope of an EA and the roles and responsibilities
associated with an EA</li>
<li>the CNSC's requirements and guidance to applicants and
licensees for developing environmental protection measures,
including an ERA where required, for both new and existing
facilities or activities</li>
</ul>
<p>REGDOC-2.9.1, <em>Environmental Principles, Assessments and
Protection Measures</em> supersedes two regulatory documents
previously published by the CNSC:</p>
<ul>
<li>P-223, <em>Protection of the Environment</em></li>
<li>REGDOC-2.9.1, <em>Environmental Protection Policies, Programs
and Procedures</em></li>
</ul>
<p>REGDOC-2.9.1, <em>Environmental Principles, Assessments and
Protection Measures</em> is intended to form part of the licensing
basis for a regulated facility or activity. It is intended for
inclusion in licences as either part of the conditions and safety
and control measures in a licence, or as part of the safety and
control measures to be described in a licence application and the
documents needed to support that application.</p>
<p>A graded approach, commensurate with risk, may be defined and
used when applying the requirements and guidance contained in this
regulatory document. The use of a graded approach is not a
relaxation of requirements. With a graded approach, the application
of requirements is commensurate with the risks and particular
characteristics of the facility or activity.</p>
<ol class="list-bullet-none">
<li><strong>Note:</strong>: For facilities or activities other than
Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills, the CNSC
reviews every licence application to verify that there are no
significant interactions with the environment (for example, for
most Class II facilities, such as hospitals and universities, and
for the use and transport of nuclear substances and radiation
devices, there is no interaction with the environment). If the
CNSC's review of the application determines that the facility or
activity:
<ul>
<li>has potential interactions with the environment and that
additional consideration of environmental protection measures is
warranted, the information in this document may be applied in a
graded manner</li>
<li>does not interact with the environment, then only the CNSC's
guiding principles for environmental protection (in section 2.1 of
this document) are relevant as guidance for such facilities or
activities</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Early engagement with CNSC staff is encouraged for facilities or
activities with potential interactions with the environment or for
applicants uncertain as to their facility's or activity's potential
for interaction with the environment. CNSC staff can provide
facility- or activity-specific guidance to assist applicants and
licensees.</p>
<p>An applicant or licensee may put forward a case to demonstrate
that the intent of a requirement is addressed by other means and
demonstrated with supportable evidence.</p>
<p>Guidance contained in this document exists to inform the
applicant, to elaborate further on requirements or to provide
direction to licensees and applicants on how to meet requirements.
It also provides more information about how CNSC staff evaluate
specific problems or data during their review of licence
applications. Licensees are expected to review and consider
guidance; should they choose not to follow it, they should explain
how their chosen alternate approach meets regulatory
requirements.</p>
<p>The requirements and guidance in this document are consistent
with modern national and international practices addressing issues
and elements that control and enhance nuclear safety. In
particular, they establish a modern, risk-informed approach to
environmental protection. <strong>Note:</strong> The intent of
these requirements is not to replace or duplicate other federal,
provincial or territorial, and municipal legislation with which
licensees must comply. Where applicable, meeting the existing
legislative requirements is adequate for meeting the requirements
of this regulatory document.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info mrgn-bttm-lg">
<p><strong>Important note:</strong> Where referenced in a licence
either directly or indirectly (such as through licensee-referenced
documents), this document is part of the licensing basis for a
regulated facility or activity.</p>
<p>The licensing basis sets the boundary conditions for acceptable
performance at a regulated facility or activity, and establishes
the basis for the CNSC’s compliance program for that regulated
facility or activity.</p>
<p>Where this document is part of the licensing basis, the word
"shall" is used to express a requirement to be satisfied by the
licensee or licence applicant. "Should" is used to express guidance
or that which is advised. "May" is used to express an option or
that which is advised or permissible within the limits of this
regulatory document. "Can" is used to express possibility or
capability.</p>
<p>Nothing contained in this document is to be construed as
relieving any licensee from any other pertinent requirements. It is
the licensee’s responsibility to identify and comply with all
applicable regulations and licence conditions.</p>

<h2 id="sec-1">1. Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="sec-1.1">1.1 Purpose</h3>
<p>Environmental protection for nuclear facilities and activities
is done in accordance with the <em>Nuclear Safety and Control
Act</em> (NSCA) and the regulations made under the NSCA. This
legislation includes provisions to ensure that licensees are
meeting the CNSC's mandate to protect the environment and the
health, safety and security of persons. The CNSC requires the
environmental effects of all nuclear facilities or activities to be
considered and evaluated when licensing decisions are made.</p>
<p>This regulatory document provides information to applicants and
licensees on protecting the environment and the health of persons,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>identification of facility or activity interactions with the
environment and the public</li>
<li>identification and mitigation of potential environmental
effects associated with these interactions</li>
<li>design and implementation of effluent and emission release
measures and of the environmental monitoring measures to confirm or
test the predictions and the actual effects</li>
<li>periodic assessments of the environmental protection measures
and the licensee's performance</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, this regulatory document describes:</p>
<ul>
<li>the CNSC's principles for environmental protection</li>
<li>for all nuclear facilities or activities that interact with the
environment, the scope of an environmental assessment (EA) and the
roles and responsibilities associated with an EA</li>
<li>the CNSC's requirements and guidance to applicants and
licensees for developing environmental protection measures,
including an environmental risk assessment (ERA) where required,
for both new and existing facilities or activities</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sec-1.2">1.2 Scope</h3>
<p>This regulatory document clarifies how the CNSC undertakes an
EA, either under the NSCA or, for designated projects, under the
<em>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012</em> (CEAA 2012).
It clarifies the CNSC's expectations of applicants and licensees
and provides guidance for protecting the environment and the health
of persons.</p>
<p>This document will be used to assess licence applications for
proposed new nuclear facilities or activities, licence applications
for existing facilities or activities (renewals and amendments),
and environmental protection measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>all licence applications that demonstrate potential
interactions between the facility or activity and the environment
are subject to an EA, either under the NSCA or under CEAA 2012</li>
<li>for each facility or activity that has direct interactions with
the environment, the applicant or licensee must demonstrate that
environmental protection measures are or will be in place</li>
<li>where an ERA is required for a facility or activity (details
are included in this regulatory document):
<ul>
<li>the ERA is subject to regular updates (at least every five
years, and whenever a significant change occurs in either the
facility or activity that could alter the nature (type or
magnitude) of the interaction with the environment</li>
<li>the licensee's ERA informs an EA under CEAA 2012 and forms the
basis of an EA under the NSCA</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases, the EA (either under CEAA 2012 or under the NSCA),
the environmental protection measures and the ERA (where required)
are commensurate with the scale and complexity of the environmental
risks associated with the nuclear facility or activity.</p>
<p>For facilities or activities other than Class I nuclear
facilities and uranium mines and mills, the CNSC reviews every
licence application to verify that there are no significant
interactions with the environment (for example, for most Class II
facilities, such as hospitals and universities, and for the use and
transport of nuclear substances and radiation devices, there is no
interaction with the environment). If the CNSC's review of the
application determines that the facility or activity:</p>
<ul>
<li>has potential interactions with the environment and that
additional consideration of environmental protection measures is
warranted, the information in this document may be applied in a
graded manner</li>
<li>does not interact with the environment, then only the CNSC's
guiding principles for environmental protection (in section 2.1 of
this document) are relevant as guidance for such facilities or
activities</li>
</ul>
<p>Early engagement with CNSC staff is encouraged for facilities or
activities with potential interactions with the environment or for
applicants uncertain as to their facility's or activity's potential
for interaction with the environment. CNSC staff can provide
facility- or activity-specific guidance to assist applicants and
licensees.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The intent of these requirements is not
to replace or duplicate other federal, provincial or territorial,
and municipal legislation with which licensees must comply. Where
applicable, meeting the existing legislative requirements is
adequate for meeting the requirements of this regulatory
document.</p>

<h2 id="sec-2">2. The CNSC's Environmental Protection
Principles</h2>
<p>Protecting the environment is part of the CNSC's mandate. The
CNSC requires the environmental effects of all facilities or
activities to be evaluated and considered when licensing decisions
are made (see figure 1). For each licensing decision, the CNSC (the
Commission or a Designated Officer) must be satisfied that the
applicant or licensee will make adequate provision for the
protection of the environment and the health and safety of persons
before a licence can be granted.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 1: Ensuring adequate provision for protection of
the environment</strong></p>
<div class="span-5"><img src="./images/fig1-eng.png" alt=
"Flow chart illustrating the CNSC's environmental assessment process" /></div>
<h3 id="sec-2.1">2.1 The CNSC's guiding principles for protection
of the environment</h3>
<p>The CNSC regulates nuclear facilities and activities in Canada
to protect the environment and the health and safety of persons in
a manner that is consistent with Canadian environmental policies,
acts and regulations and with Canada's international
obligations.</p>
<p>For each facility or activity that has direct interactions with
the environment, the CNSC must determine that the licensee or
applicant has made adequate provision for the protection of the
environment. The applicant or licensee's licence application must
demonstrate (through performance assessments, monitoring or other
assessments) that their environmental protection measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>are commensurate with the level of risk associated with the
activity</li>
<li>recognize that uncertainty exists in science and account for
this uncertainty:
<ul>
<li>by keeping all releases to the environment as low as reasonably
achievable (ALARA), social and economic factors being taken into
account for nuclear substances [8]</li>
<li>through the application of the best available technology and
techniques economically achievable (BATEA) for hazardous
substances</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>respect the precautionary principle, the "polluter pays"
principle, and the concepts of pollution prevention, sustainable
development and adaptive management</li>
<li>are assessed against performance indicators and targets that
are based on sound science</li>
</ul>
<p>The following sections of this regulatory document provide
information on how to meet these principles. The CNSC assesses
proposed alternative approaches and takes into account the views
and proposals of the licensee concerning their individual
situations.</p>
<h3 id="sec-2.2">2.2 The CNSC's environmental protection
framework</h3>
<p>The CNSC's environmental protection safety and control area
(SCA) covers measures that identify, control and monitor all
releases of radioactive and hazardous substances and effects on the
environment from facilities or as the result of licensed
activities.</p>
<p>The applicant's or licensee's environmental protection measures
should address all aspects of the CNSC's environmental protection
SCA that are relevant to the facility or activity. The scope and
complexity within each measure should be commensurate with the
nature and scale of the interactions with the environment that may
result from the facility or activity.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The CNSC uses the term "environmental
protection measures". The elements in these measures may be
referenced by applicants and licensees in their "environmental
protection programs". Applicants and licensees are not required to
update their management system or other documents to reflect the
term "environmental protection measures", but they must meet the
requirements listed in this document.</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows the cyclical nature of an ERA and how the ERA
links to the effluent monitoring and environmental monitoring
measures, illustrating how the ERA and the monitoring measures
inform each other.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 2: Interrelationships between the ERA and
monitoring</strong></p>
<div class="span-5"><img src="./images/fig2-eng.png" alt=
"" /></div>
<p>The CNSC's regulatory framework for environmental
protection:</p>
<ul>
<li>respects other federal and provincial environmental
legislation</li>
<li>applies the following standards in a graded approach,
commensurate with risk:
<ul>
<li>CSA N288.4, <em>Environmental monitoring programs at Class I
nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills</em> [4]</li>
<li>CSA N288.5, <em>Effluent monitoring programs at Class I nuclear
facilities and uranium mines and mills</em> [5]</li>
<li>CSA N288.6, <em>Environmental risk assessment at Class I
nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills</em> [6] (and, for
further information on human exposure modelling, see CSA N288.1,
<em>Guidelines for calculating derived release limits for
radioactive material in airborne and liquid effluents for normal
operation of nuclear facilities</em> [3])</li>
<li>CSA N288.7, <em>Groundwater protection programs at Class I
nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills</em> [7]</li>
<li>CAN/CSA ISO 14001, <em>Environmental Management Systems –
Requirements with Guidance for Use</em> [1, 2]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These CSA standards apply to Class I nuclear facilities and
uranium mines and mills. The CSA standards ensure that the risks
associated with releases to the environment are continually
assessed and mitigated; that releases are controlled and monitored;
and that the environment is monitored. See section 4 for additional
information on the application and implementation of these CSA
standards, as well as other elements of environmental protection
(for example, an environmental management system (EMS)).</p>
<p>For facilities or activities other than Class I nuclear
facilities and uranium mines and mills, the CNSC reviews every
licence application to verify that there are no significant
interactions with the environment (for example, for most Class II
facilities, such as hospitals and universities, and for the use and
transport of nuclear substances and radiation devices, there is no
interaction with the environment). If the CNSC's review of the
application determines that the facility or activity has potential
interactions with the environment (such as planned releases of
radioactive or hazardous substances to the environment) and that
additional consideration of environmental protection measures is
warranted, the applicant or licensee applies the information in
section 4 to their environmental protection measures in a graded
approach, commensurate with risk.</p>
<p>The CNSC also regulates many facilities and activities that do
not have any interactions with the environment (that is, the
facility or activity has no direct releases to the environment). A
licence application that describes the nature of the proposed
licensed activities is considered sufficient for ensuring
protection of the environment, provided that CNSC staff conclude
the facility or activities do not interact with the environment. In
this case, the remaining information in this document does not
apply to such facilities or activities.</p>
<p>Early engagement with CNSC staff is encouraged for facilities or
activities with potential interactions with the environment. CNSC
staff can provide facility- or activity-specific guidance to assist
applicants and licensees.</p>
<h3 id="sec-2.3">2.3 Other jurisdictions and federal
departments</h3>
<p>The CNSC cooperates with other jurisdictions and federal
departments to protect the environment. Where appropriate, the CNSC
may enter into formal arrangements to increase the effectiveness of
environmental protection. For example, the CNSC holds memoranda of
understanding (MOUs) with other federal departments (such as
Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Environment and Climate Change
Canada). A complete list of MOUs is available on the <a href=
"http://www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca/">CNSC's website</a>.</p>
<p>When a proposed facility or activity must also comply with
provincial or territorial legislation, the CNSC collaborates and
coordinates the environmental protection processes where possible
to increase efficiency and reduce duplication.</p>
<h3 id="sec-2.4">2.4 Public and Aboriginal engagement</h3>
<p>Participation opportunities for the public and for Aboriginal
groups are an important component of the CNSC's EA and licensing
processes. The CNSC determines the appropriate level of
participation opportunities on a case-by-case basis. The criteria
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>interests of the public and Aboriginal groups</li>
<li>the complexity of the facility or activity and its potential
interactions with the environment and the public</li>
<li>additional factors such as other jurisdictional mandates or
type of decision</li>
</ul>

<p class="text-right"><a href="#wb-main">Top of page</a></p>
<h2 id="sec-3">3. Environmental Assessments</h2>
<p>The CNSC requires that the environmental effects of all nuclear
facilities or activities be considered and evaluated when licensing
decisions are made. All licence applications that demonstrate
potential interactions with the environment are subject to an
environmental assessment (EA), commensurate with the scale and
complexity of the environmental risks associated with the facility
or activity.</p>
<p>EAs are carried out either under the <em>Canadian Environmental
Assessment Act, 2012</em> (an EA under CEAA 2012) or under the
<em>Nuclear Safety and Control Act</em> (an EA under the NSCA).
Early in the process, CNSC staff determine which type of EA applies
by reviewing the information provided by the applicant or licensee
in a project description (CEAA 2012) or licence application and
supporting documentation. The CNSC conducts EAs under CEAA 2012 for
designated projects listed in the <em>Regulations Designating
Physical Activities</em>. EAs under the NSCA are conducted for
projects not listed in those regulations or, for projects
previously assessed under CEAA 2012 (or its predecessor CEAA 1992)
but at the end of their licence term and for which the proposed
licence renewal or amendments are not listed in those regulations.
For both types of EAs, the core scientific basis used to satisfy
either EA is the same and a lifecycle approach with public and
Aboriginal participation is taken.</p>
<p>For projects proposed to be carried out on federal lands as
defined in section 66 of CEAA 2012, and requiring a decision by the
CNSC as the federal authority , the Commission must determine
whether the completion of a proposed project is likely to cause
significant adverse environmental effects, in accordance with
section 67 of CEAA 2012. For additional information, refer to
<em>Projects on Federal Lands and Outside Canada under the Canadian
Environmental Assessment Act, 2012</em> [12] and technical guidance
document <em>Projects on Federal Lands: Making a determination
under section 67 of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act,
2012</em> [13].</p>
<p>CEAA 2012 may not apply in certain parts of Canada where settled
Aboriginal land claim agreements have associated EA processes.
Under CEAA 2012, the application may be subject to a federal,
provincial, or territorial decision. For applicants proposing
facilities or activities in areas of Canada subject to land claim
agreements (such as the territories and parts of Quebec and of
Newfoundland and Labrador), the CNSC may act as technical advisor
and be an active participant at all stages of the EA process. The
CNSC retains decision-making authority on all licensing matters
under the NSCA and the Commission will use the information gathered
in the EA process to inform its licensing decision under the
NSCA.</p>
<p>Where required, the applicant or licensee's ERA informs an EA
under CEAA 2012 and forms the basis for an EA under the NSCA. CNSC
staff use the information available in the ERA to assess the
environmental effects of the facility or activity.</p>
<h3 id="sec-3.1">3.1 Environmental assessments under CEAA 2012</h3>
<p>An EA under CEAA 2012 is an assessment of the environmental
effects of a designated project that is conducted in accordance
with CEAA 2012. A designated project is defined in section 2 of
CEAA 2012 and outlined in the <em>Regulations Designating Physical
Activities</em>.</p>
<p>An EA under CEAA 2012 is carried out early in the licensing
process (at the beginning of the project's lifecycle) and serves as
a planning tool. The process for an EA under CEAA 2012 is described
in appendix A.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Because every facility or activity that
successfully goes through the process of an EA under CEAA 2012 will
eventually go through the process of an EA under the NSCA, CNSC
staff endeavour to make one as rigorous as the other. For every EA
under CEAA 2012, the facility or activity will eventually be
reviewed as part of the CNSC's ongoing assessment of the
environment under its environmental protection framework and an EA
report for an EA under the NSCA will be produced at each phase of
the licensing cycle.</p>
<h3 id="sec-3.2">3.2 Environmental assessments under the NSCA</h3>
<p>EAs under the NSCA are conducted for projects not listed in the
<em>Regulations Designating Physical Activities</em> or, for
projects previously assessed under CEAA 2012 (or its predecessor
CEAA 1992) but at the end of their licence term and for which the
proposed licence renewal or amendments are not listed in those
regulations.</p>
<p>The CNSC has adopted a policy for which the process of an EA
under the NSCA (as outlined below) is used to continually assess
the potential environmental effects and health effects for all
licence applications that demonstrate potential interactions
between a facility or activity and the environment. An EA under the
NSCA is an ongoing assessment of the environment conducted at every
phase throughout the lifecycle of the facility or activity to meet
the NSCA`s requirements. At each phase (that is, for each licence
application), CNSC staff consider all future phases of the
lifecycle, taking into consideration available information. Similar
to all other safety and control areas (SCAs), an EA under the NSCA
is the process of ongoing verification related to the environmental
protection SCA.</p>
<p>An EA under the NSCA is a technical assessment by CNSC staff of
information required under the NSCA and the regulations made under
the NSCA to inform the licensing decision on whether the applicant
or licensee will, in carrying on a licensed activity, make adequate
provision for the protection of the environment and the health of
persons. The assessment includes CNSC staff's recommendation on
whether the applicant or licensee's environmental protection
measures are adequate.</p>
<p>An EA report for an EA under the NSCA is prepared by CNSC staff
for each subsequent licence application for an existing licensed
facility or activity.</p>
<p>An EA under the NSCA is an ongoing environmental protection tool
that the CNSC uses to assess the licensee's environmental
protection measures throughout the CNSC's ongoing licensing,
compliance monitoring and verification processes to inform the EA
report. This assessment is commensurate with the scale and
complexity of the environmental risks associated with the nuclear
facility or activity.</p>
<h4 id="sec-3.2.1">3.2.1 Overview of the process for an
environmental assessment under the NSCA</h4>
<p>For an EA under the NSCA, CNSC staff conduct a technical review
of the information (such as the licence application and its
supporting documentation) that the applicant or licensee is
required to submit to the CNSC through the established licensing
process and, as part of the CNSC's ongoing regulatory oversight, a
review of information on the licensee's environmental protection
measures to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>An EA under the NSCA may be informed by additional material; for
example:</p>
<ul>
<li>data from the CNSC's independent environmental monitoring
program (IEMP)</li>
<li>CNSC staff's compliance verification activities</li>
<li>annual environmental monitoring reports</li>
<li>previous EAs and follow up programs</li>
<li>decommissioning plans</li>
<li>Aboriginal and public input</li>
</ul>
<p>An EA under the NSCA is carried out within the CNSC's licensing
process and its associated timelines. There is no decision on the
EA report itself; however, the report's objective is to provide the
necessary information under the environmental protection SCA so
that a licensing decision under the NSCA can be made with
confidence that the environment and the health of persons will be
protected, as well as to increase transparency to the public and
Aboriginal groups.</p>
<h4 id="sec-3.2.2">3.2.2 Applicant or licensee's participation</h4>
<p>The applicant or licensee participates in the CNSC's process for
an EA under the NSCA at the following stages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-application engagement:</strong><br />
To ensure the applicant or licensee understands all appropriate EA
requirements, they are encouraged to seek CNSC guidance at the
earliest possible stage of planning before submitting a licence
application.</li>
<li><strong>Licence application:</strong>
<ul>
<li>CNSC staff use the information in the licence application and
other documentation (such as the CNSC's independent environmental
monitoring program, annual environmental monitoring reports, and
CNSC staff compliance verification activities) to conduct an EA
under the NSCA.</li>
<li>The licence application must contain sufficient information to
meet regulatory requirements and, as it relates to this document,
demonstrate that the applicant or licensee will make adequate
provision for the protection of the environment. During CNSC
staff's technical review of the licence application, the applicant
or licensee is responsible for addressing all issues identified by
the CNSC.</li>
<li>For every facility or activity, the applicant or licensee is
required to submit information on their environmental protection
measures commensurate with the scale and complexity of the
environmental risks associated with the facility or activity (see
section 4 for additional information). The set of environmental
protection measures is an important component of the licence
application.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public participation:</strong><br />
The applicant or licensee has the opportunity to provide responses
to questions or concerns raised during public participation. This
opportunity may be at a Commission proceeding (for example, a
meeting, a hearing or an abridged hearing).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sec-3.2.3">3.2.3 Applicant or licensee's environmental risk
assessment for an environmental assessment under the NSCA</h4>
<p>Where required, the applicant or licensee's ERA supports
environmental protection throughout the regulatory lifecycle of a
facility or activity and forms the basis of an EA under the
NSCA.</p>
<p>The ERA is reviewed and revised periodically. Revisions to the
ERA are informed by the accumulated site knowledge derived from
operational experience, monitoring, special investigations, the
incorporation of advances in scientific knowledge and, if
available, Aboriginal traditional knowledge. As a result, the
initial ERA evolves through the life of the facility or activity,
remaining current and becoming increasingly more site-specific. The
evolution of the ERA through accumulated monitoring data and new
scientific knowledge decreases uncertainty, thereby enhancing the
licensee's ability to assess the significance of deviations from
predictions of environmental performance. This approach promotes
continual improvement and informed adaptive management to protect
the environment by providing an opportunity for early intervention
(mitigation measures) to deviations in predicted environmental
performance.</p>
<p>For information on the requirements and guidance for performing
an ERA (where required), refer to section 4.</p>
<h4 id="sec-3.2.4">3.2.4 The CNSC's process for an environmental
assessment under the NSCA</h4>
<p>The CNSC's process for an EA under the NSCA includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>pre-application engagement</li>
<li>a technical review of the licensee's licence application and
supporting information</li>
<li>documenting the EA findings</li>
<li>determining and organizing opportunities for public and
Aboriginal participation, as appropriate</li>
<li>considering the EA information to inform a licensing decision
<ol class="list-bullet-none">
<li>
<p><strong>Pre-application engagement</strong></p>
<p>Pre-application engagement with the CNSC is recommended.
Applicants may begin to determine the feasibility of a facility or
activity well before submitting a licence application. At this
time, the CNSC would provide potential licensees with:</p>
<ul>
<li>the legislative and regulatory requirements and the policy
context</li>
<li>the expected scope and identification of any technical support
studies required</li>
<li>information on the CNSC's licensing process</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>The CNSC can provide guidance, as appropriate or upon request.
The EA information required by CNSC staff is based on the
information that is required in the licence application to meet the
requirements of the NSCA and the regulations made under the
NSCA.</p>
<li>
<p><strong>Technical review of the licensee's licence application
and supporting information</strong></p>
<p>CNSC staff perform a technical review of the licence application
and supporting documentation.</p>
<p>The scope of the technical review varies, depending on the
complexity of the facility or activity, the anticipated
interactions with the environment and the type of licensing
decision being sought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Documenting the EA findings</strong></p>
<p>CNSC staff document the EA findings of the technical review, in
alignment with the facility- or activity-specific licensing
process, to inform the licensing decision. The licensing decision
is made by either the designated officer or the Commission. The EA
findings include CNSC staff's recommendation to the decision-making
authority on whether the licensee will make adequate provision for
the protection of the environment and the health of persons.</p>
<p>For licence applications of existing facilities or activities,
the EA findings are an update on CNSC staff's review of the
licensee's environmental protection measures to ensure the adequacy
of the measures in continuing to protect the environment.</p>
<p>For all proposed facilities and activities with environmental
interactions, CNSC staff prepare an EA report documenting the
findings of the EA under the NSCA. On a case-by-case basis, CNSC
staff determine the appropriate level of detail and content of the
EA report, based on and commensurate with the scale and complexity
of the facility or activity and taking into consideration
Aboriginal, public and regulatory interest.</p>
<p>An EA report describes and summarizes the results of
environmental monitoring, effluent and emissions monitoring and the
risks to the environment and the public. Where available,
environmental compliance monitoring data and the results of IEMP
conducted near facilities are also included in the EA report. In
particular, the EA report covers those elements of the facility or
activity that are deemed to be of Aboriginal, public or regulatory
interest. Any EA report that is prepared will be made available to
the public on request.</p>
<p>Documents being presented to the Commission for a licensing
decision are made available to the public on request, subject to
confidentiality requirements. Aboriginal groups and the public may
be provided an opportunity to review the information and to provide
their comments at a Commission proceeding. If warranted by public
or Aboriginal interest, the EA report will be provided for
information in advance of a Commission proceeding for consideration
of the licence application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Determining and organizing opportunities for public and
Aboriginal participation</strong></p>
<p>CNSC staff may organize an external review of the EA report. An
EA under the NSCA allows for engagement on a case-by-case basis
with the public and Aboriginal groups on the EA report before the
licensing decision.</p>
<p>For additional information, refer to REGDOC-3.2.2,
<em>Aboriginal Engagement</em> [10].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Considering the EA information to inform a licensing
decision</strong></p>
<p>For Commission-delegated Designated Officer decisions, the
Designated Officer considers the EA findings in the facility- or
activity-specific licensing decision-making process.</p>
<p>For Commission decisions, the Commission considers the EA
findings in the facility- or activity-specific licensing process.
When the licensing decision rests with the Commission, the
Commission may consider the EA findings in a public hearing. During
the hearing, the Commission may accept written or oral
interventions. In advance of the hearing, the CNSC posts a notice
on the CNSC website and to the CNSC subscription list, advertises
in local media and sends a formal notice to identified Aboriginal
groups and to participants in any facility- or activity-specific
engagement activities.</p>
<p>Following the hearing, the Commission makes its decision. The
Commission Secretariat issues the <em>Record of Proceedings,
Including Reasons for Decision</em>. This record is posted on the
CNSC website. A copy of the decision report is sent to the
Aboriginal groups that participated in the review, and is available
on request for other Aboriginal groups and members of the
public.</p>

<h2 id="sec-4">4. Environmental Protection Measures</h2>
<p>The necessary measures for environmental protection are
determined on a facility- or activity-specific basis. Note: Not
every facility or activity is required to have every environmental
protection measure described in this section. The applicant or
licensee may address certain requirements by demonstrating that a
particular measure is not necessary or does not apply to that
facility or activity. A licence application that describes the
nature of the proposed licensed activities is considered sufficient
for ensuring protection of the environment, provided CNSC staff
conclude that the facility or activities do not interact with the
environment.</p>
<h3 id="sec-4.1">4.1 Environmental risk assessment</h3>
<p>An ERA is a systematic process that identifies, quantifies and
characterizes the risk posed by contaminants (nuclear or hazardous
substances) and physical stressors in the environment. It is a
practice or methodology that provides science-based information to
support decision-making and to prioritize the implementation of
mitigation measures.</p>
<p>The applicant or licensee's ERA informs an EA under CEAA 2012
and forms the basis of an EA under the NSCA. The ERA:</p>
<ul>
<li>identifies facility- or activity-specific characteristics and
site-specific environmental characteristics</li>
<li>identifies interactions between those characteristics</li>
<li>assesses the likelihood and significance of these interactions
and the resulting potential effects on the environment and the
public</li>
</ul>
<p>In conjunction with regulatory monitoring requirements, the ERA
and its associated performance predictions serve as the basis for
control and monitoring of releases, environmental monitoring, and
any supplementary studies. All of these measures are interrelated
and managed within the environmental management system (EMS). For
additional information on an EMS, see section 4.6.</p>
<p>The initial ERA for a new facility or activity is based on best
estimates of the facility- or activity-specific characteristics.
These characteristics are combined with sufficient environmental
characterization (such as baseline) to support the assessment of
potential interactions with the environment and the potential for
associated environmental effects.</p>
<p>The ERA uses the facility- or activity-specific estimates of
physical disturbances and chemical releases (both nuclear and
hazardous substances) to predict:</p>
<ul>
<li>the source terms of gaseous and liquid discharges</li>
<li>the transport of nuclear and hazardous substances through the
environment</li>
<li>public exposure and dose</li>
<li>exposure and effects on representative biota</li>
<li>changes in habitat and effects on species that rely on that
habitat</li>
</ul>
<p>These predictions establish the basis for the CNSC's compliance
program for that facility or activity.</p>
<p>The applicant or licensee incorporates the results of the
initial ERA into their EMS, including the effluent and
environmental monitoring measures. The predictions for physical
disturbances and releases, and the associated environmental
behavior and potential effects, are measured and tested using
site-specific monitoring.</p>
<p>The initial ERA submitted for licensing purposes for a new
facility or activity is primarily predictive as it involves
assessing the potential effects of a hypothetical facility or
activity. As a facility or activity moves through its lifecycle,
the ERA is periodically reviewed and revised (see section 4.1.2)
using the accumulated site knowledge derived from operational
experience, monitoring, special investigations, incorporation of
advances in scientific knowledge and, where available, Aboriginal
traditional knowledge.</p>
<p>These "living" ERAs, which are informed by real data from
monitoring programs (emissions, effluents, environmental) and
current science, are used to assess if the original environmental
impact predictions are exceeded or may be exceeded in the future.
In this manner, the initial ERA evolves through the life of the
facility or activity, remaining current and becoming an
increasingly more powerful site specific tool.</p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>For Class I facilities and uranium mines and mills, the licensee
shall conduct an ERA in accordance with CSA N288.6,
<em>Environmental risk assessment at Class I nuclear facilities and
uranium mines and mills</em> [6].</p>
<p>The ERA shall be completed in a systematic, scientifically
defensible manner that identifies, quantifies and characterizes the
risk posed by releases of nuclear and hazardous substances and
physical disturbances (stressors) on representative human and
non-human biota. The licensee shall ensure that the ERA includes,
as applicable to the facility or activity, both an ecological risk
assessment (EcoRA) for the environment and a human health risk
assessment (HHRA) for members of the public.</p>
<h4>Guidance</h4>
<p>For facilities or activities other than Class I nuclear
facilities and uranium mines and mills, for which the CNSC has
determined that there are direct interactions with the environment,
the licensee should use the ERA process described in CSA N288.6 [6]
in a graded approach as appropriate to their circumstances. For
many of these facilities, a simple screening assessment (as
described in CSA N288.6) is adequate. <strong>Note:</strong>
Although CSA N288.6 was developed for Class I facilities and
uranium mines and mills, the methodology and general principles can
be applied to other facilities and activities regulated by the
CNSC.</p>
<p>Early engagement with the CNSC is encouraged for facilities and
activities that are not specifically addressed by CSA N288.6 [6].
The CNSC can provide facility- or activity-specific guidance to
assist licensees.</p>
<h4 id="sec-4.1.1">4.1.1 Complexity of the environmental risk
assessment</h4>
<h5>Requirements</h5>
<p>The applicant or licensee shall identify facility
characteristics and activities that may interact with the
environment during the relevant phase of the facility or activity's
lifecycle (for example, site preparation, construction, operation
and decommissioning).</p>
<p>This characterization shall include descriptions of facility- or
activity-specific performance with respect to:</p>
<ul>
<li>physical disturbances (for example, footprint for surface
structures, below-grade structures, diversions or flow alterations
of surface or groundwater)</li>
<li>emissions released to the environment</li>
<li>effluents released to the environment</li>
</ul>
<p>The facility or activity characterization shall be of sufficient
detail to assess the potential for effects arising from the
proposed maximum quantities and anticipated volumes and flow rates
for releases associated with the facility or activity.</p>
<p>The applicant or licensee shall present a characterization of
the baseline environment (that is, the environment before any
development of the facility or activity has started) for any
portion of the environment where the site characterization
indicates potential for interaction.</p>
<p>The applicant or licensee shall use the facility- or
activity-specific characterization and the local environmental
baseline characterization to identify the potential interactions
between the facility or activity and the surrounding environment.
Note that these identified interactions will become the focus of
further stages within the ERA.</p>
<p>The applicant or licensee shall use the potential environmental
interactions to support their justification as to the level of
complexity for the ERA in accordance with CSA N288.6,
<em>Environmental risk assessment at Class I nuclear facilities and
uranium mines and mills</em> [6].</p>
<h5>Guidance</h5>
<p>ERAs may be completed in a tiered manner reflecting the
complexity of the disturbances and releases associated with the
facility or activity and with the complexity or sensitivity of the
surrounding environment. This tiered approach allows the rapid
completion of simple screening risk assessments for facilities or
activities with limited interaction with the receiving environment
or the public. However, it also allows for progressively more
complex quantitative assessments for facilities or activities when
warranted by the severity and the spatial and temporal extent of
potential effects (see figure 3).</p>
<p><strong>Figure 3: Tiered options for environmental risk
assessments (simplified from CSA N288.6 [6])</strong></p>
<div class="col-md-6 mrgn-lft-xl"><img src="./images/fig3-eng.png"
alt=
"Flow chart illustrating the environmental risk assessment process" /></div>
<h5>Reviewing and revising the environmental risk assessment</h5>
<p>Where an ERA exists, the licensee shall review and revise the
ERA in accordance with CSA N288.6, <em>Environmental risk
assessment at Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and
mills</em> [6]; taking into consideration whether there has
been:</p>
<ul>
<li>a significant change in the facility or activity that could
alter the nature (type or magnitude) of the interactions with the
environment (such as modification, expansion or refurbishment of
the facility) within the ERA predictions</li>
<li>any transition to a new phase in the lifecycle (such as a
transition to licence to operate, decommission or abandon) where
the application for the new licensing phase includes any
interactions with the environment that were not previously captured
in the ERA</li>
</ul>
<p>The ERA shall be revised with site knowledge derived from:</p>
<ul>
<li>operational experience (for example, performance of mitigation
measures such as effluent control systems)</li>
<li>results of monitoring</li>
<li>supplementary studies</li>
<li>incorporation of recent developments in scientific
knowledge</li>
</ul>
<p>The revised ERA shall be used to assess the environmental
performance of the facility or activity. The ERA shall also be used
to predict continued future performance and associated
environmental effects of the facility or activity.</p>
<p>If the revised ERA indicates that the nature, extent and
significance of environmental effects are greater than predicted,
the licensee shall:</p>
<ul>
<li>evaluate the environmental effects in terms of risk</li>
<li>investigate mitigation measures as necessary</li>
<li>identify any changes needed to the effluent and emissions
monitoring measures resulting from any mitigation measures</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sec-4.2">4.2 Effluent and emissions control and
monitoring</h3>
<p>Controls on environmental releases are established to provide
protection to the environment and to respect the principles of
sustainable development and pollution prevention.</p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>The preventive and control measures shall be based on the
potential risks to the environment that the facility or activity
may pose.</p>
<p>The effluent and emissions control and monitoring shall:</p>
<ul>
<li>identify and document the infrastructure and activities (such
as pipelines or storage) with the potential for significant
accidental release to the environment of nuclear and hazardous
substances and the barriers (such as primary and secondary
containment, and liners) to prevent releases</li>
<li>identify and document the points of release to the environment
and the corresponding preventive control measures and equipment
necessary to regulate and control the release of these nuclear and
hazardous substances in the authorized manner</li>
<li>estimate or measure, document and report the quality and
quantity of releases to the environment</li>
<li>verify the nature and quantity of releases against compliance
criteria (such as authorized release limits), performance
indicators (such as action levels) and the predictions of releases
used as input parameters for the site-specific ERA</li>
<li>evaluate mitigation measures to further control releases when
the monitoring results identify deviations from the expected
performance</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sec-4.2.1">4.2.1 Control of environmental releases</h4>
<p>The effluent and emissions preventive and control measures are
established on the basis of best industry practice, incorporating
the application of BATEA, ALARA, process optimization, continuous
improvement and the results of an ERA.</p>
<h5>Guidance</h5>
<p>A licensee's effluent and emissions control should address the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>BATEA assessment of pollution prevention and control
technologies:
<ul>
<li>design and maintenance of engineered barriers between key waste
streams and sources of nuclear and hazardous substances (for
example, double-lined piping, secondary containment and sumps,
waste rock pads and pond liners), with maintenance programs to
ensure the integrity of these barriers</li>
<li>wastewater treatment systems (for example, precipitation and
settling systems, ion-exchange columns, evaporators and membrane
separation systems such as reverse osmosis) that minimize the
contaminants released to surface waters from liquid effluent
streams with maintenance programs to ensure the availability and
performance of these systems</li>
<li>air pollution control technology systems (for example, HEPA
filters, baghouse filters, wet/dry scrubbers, absorption/adsorption
systems) that minimize air pollutants released to the environment
via air emissions through stacks or as fugitive emissions from the
facilities with maintenance programs to ensure the availability and
performance of these systems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>BATEA assessment of techniques:
<ul>
<li>a focus on BATEA optimization; that is, the application of
pollution prevention performance standards, design objectives and
best practices to minimize or eliminate the release of nuclear or
hazardous substances to the environment:
<ul>
<li>both operational and managerial practices that can influence
the quality of releases to the environment (for example, upstream
and downstream process optimization, adequate training of staff and
effective overall management of the operation)</li>
<li>application and continual review of action levels as indicators
of a potential loss of control of the site-specific environmental
protection measures, to ensure the process is operating within its
approved design specification and normal operating conditions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ALARA assessments (minimization-focused); that is, the
application of radiation protection principles to effectively
minimize human and environmental exposure to nuclear
substances</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>processes and procedures to ensure effective management of the
effluent and emission control systems within an EMS (for example,
maintenance of treatment systems, timely replacement of filters,
calibration of monitoring equipment and procedures detailing
appropriate responses to action level exceedances)</li>
</ul>
<p>After the facility or activity is licensed, BATEA assessments of
pollution prevention and control technologies for releases are
necessary only where effects exceed, or may exceed, those
identified in the ERA and adaptive management involving the
modification or reduction of releases of specific nuclear or
hazardous substances is indicated.</p>
<p>Assessments of techniques and the processes and procedures for
ensuring effective effluent and emission control programs should be
reviewed as part of the EMS requirement for continuous
improvement.</p>
<h4 id="sec-4.2.2">4.2.2 Monitoring of releases to the
environment</h4>
<p>In conjunction with specific regulatory monitoring requirements,
the ERA provides the technical foundation and structure for
identifying the need for, and details of, effluent and emissions
monitoring. The site-specific effluent and emissions monitoring is
designed using the characterization of the locations, the
anticipated volume, chemistry and flow rate of releases, and the
proposed maximum quantities and concentrations of nuclear and
hazardous substances (including their physical, chemical and
radiological characteristics).</p>
<p>For facilities and activities with no significant measurable
releases to the environment, effluent and emissions monitoring is
not required. In such cases, the licensee should demonstrate
(through engineering or scientific methods) that appropriate
barriers and practices are in place, and are monitored and
maintained to prevent releases to the environment.</p>
<p>For facilities and activities where the releases are of low risk
or quantities are too low or too difficult to measure, monitoring
is not required. The licensee may estimate emissions based on
site-specific process chemistry and engineering principles.</p>
<h5>Requirements</h5>
<p>For Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills, the
effluent and emissions monitoring shall address the requirements in
CSA N288.5, <em>Effluent monitoring programs at Class I nuclear
facilities and uranium mines and mills</em> [5].</p>
<p>The effluent and emissions monitoring shall be designed and
implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>to demonstrate compliance with authorized release limits</li>
<li>to respond to any action levels or other performance
indicators, internal objectives or targets set on releases for
effluent control</li>
<li>to confirm the adequacy of controls on releases from the
source</li>
<li>to provide supportive data required to assess the level of risk
on human health and safety and potential effects on the environment
as determined by the ERA or regulation</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the licensee shall ensure that the effluent and
emissions monitoring:</p>
<ul>
<li>demonstrates that controlled releases to water frequented by
fish are not acutely toxic</li>
<li>supports and assesses the adequacy of any adaptive management
measures</li>
</ul>
<p>For Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills, the
applicant or licensee shall assess and document the need for action
levels. The applicant or licensee shall engage with CNSC staff on
the requirements for establishing and implementing action levels
for releases to the environment.</p>
<p>For facilities and activities subject to the <em>Uranium Mines
and Mills Regulations</em>, the licensee shall develop a
facility-specific code of practice that includes, where
appropriate, action levels for releases of nuclear and hazardous
substances to the environment.</p>
<p>The applicant or licensee shall assess for acute lethality any
effluents that are released to water frequented by fish and that
contain hazardous substances that could be considered deleterious
under the Fisheries Act. Meeting existing federal or provincial
requirements for toxicity testing shall be considered as satisfying
this requirement. Otherwise, the method(s), frequency of testing
and actions to be implemented as a result of a test failure shall
be developed during licensing and shall be informed by existing
standard practices applied to other industrial sectors.</p>
<h5>Guidance</h5>
<p>For facilities or activities other than Class I nuclear
facilities and uranium mines and mills, for which the CNSC has
determined that there are direct interactions with the environment,
the licensee should use the process described in CSA N288.5 [5] in
a graded approach as appropriate to their circumstances. Note:
Although CSA N288.5 [5] was developed for Class I facilities and
uranium mines and mills, the methodology and general principles can
be applied to other facilities and activities regulated by the
CNSC.</p>
<p>The measurement and evaluation of environmental releases are key
to verifying the efficacy of preventive and control measures. The
overall process should include feedback mechanisms (both periodic
and continual) to assess and implement actions to achieve
performance targets. Monitoring should be conducted on a temporal
scale relevant to the nature and complexity of the release (such as
intermittent, continuous or batch), and should use a standard
sampling methodology (or a non-standard methodology approved by
CNSC staff) that is appropriate for the type of release (see figure
4).</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Figure 4: Types of releases that may be associated with
a nuclear facility or activity that can influence sampling
methodology and frequency (CSA N288.5 [5])</strong></p>
<div class="span-5"><img src="./images/fig4-eng.png" alt=
"" /></div>
<p>Effluent and emission monitoring addresses both the nature and
quantities of releases of nuclear and hazardous substances
(including wastes). Performance indicators for operational control,
such as action levels (where required), should be established to
serve as early indicators of potential loss of control or deviation
from expected quality or quantity of releases. Performance
indicators should be designed to initiate investigation of abnormal
situations and, if necessary, result in corrective measures.
Measurement and evaluation should be coordinated to permit timely
corrective action.</p>
<p>For facilities and activities other than Class I nuclear
facilities and uranium mines and mills, for which the CNSC has
determined that there are direct interactions with the environment,
licensees should consider incorporating the development of similar
environmental performance indicators, such as action levels, in
their effluent and emission monitoring.</p>
<h3 id="sec-4.3">4.3 Environmental monitoring</h3>
<p>Environmental monitoring consists of a risk-informed set of
integrated and documented activities to sample, measure, analyze,
interpret and report one or all of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the concentration of nuclear and hazardous substances in
environmental media to assess one or both of:
<ul>
<li>the exposure of receptors to those substances</li>
<li>the potential effects on human health, safety and the
environment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the intensity of physical stressors and/or their potential
effect on human health and the environment</li>
<li>the physical, chemical and biological parameters of the
environment normally considered in the design of the environmental
monitoring necessary to support the interpretation of the results;
some examples are supportive data for transport (such as wind
velocity) or toxicity assessment (such as organic carbon or
hardness) or measurements at reference stations (where incorporated
in the monitoring)</li>
</ul>
<h5>Requirements</h5>
<p>For Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills, the
licensee shall ensure that the environmental monitoring addresses
CSA N288.4, <em>Environmental monitoring programs at Class I
nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills</em> [4].</p>
<p>The licensee shall use applicable regulatory monitoring
requirements and the ERA to identify the need for and complexity of
the environmental monitoring. The licensee shall provide
justification to support whether ERA derived environmental
monitoring is required. In the justification, the licensee shall
address:</p>
<ul>
<li>characteristics of the licensed facility or activity</li>
<li>characteristics of the surrounding environment</li>
<li>nuclear and hazardous substances and physical stressors</li>
<li>receptors that can be affected</li>
<li>spatial extent of potential exposures</li>
<li>severity, probability, and spatial and temporal extent of any
potential biological effects</li>
</ul>
<p>The licensee shall ensure that the environmental monitoring
measures, plans and data provide sufficient information to assess
exposure or potential effects on human health and the environment
due to releases or physical perturbations resulting from the
facility or activity.</p>
<p>The licensee shall ensure that the results of the environmental
monitoring are used to confirm that the effects on the environment
are within the licensing predictions and adequate provisions are in
place to protect the environment.</p>
<h5>Guidance</h5>
<p>For facilities or activities other than Class I nuclear
facilities and uranium mines and mills, for which the CNSC has
determined that there are direct interactions with the environment,
the licensee should use the process described in CSA N288.4,
<em>Environmental monitoring programs at Class I nuclear facilities
and uranium mines and mills</em> [4] in a graded approach, as
appropriate to their circumstances. Note: Although CSA N288.4 [4]
was developed for Class I facilities and uranium mines and mills,
the methodology and general principles can be applied to other
facilities and activities regulated by the CNSC.</p>
<p>Monitoring for the presence of stressors (physical stressors or
nuclear and hazardous substances) in the environment is sometimes
more informative than monitoring the release at the source. The
practice of monitoring ambient air quality is common for
atmospheric emissions, especially fugitive or diffuse emissions
(such as radon from ore pads).</p>
<p>The results of the environmental monitoring should:</p>
<ul>
<li>be used to validate the predictions related to transport of
nuclear and hazardous substances through the environment and the
magnitude and extent of any effects predicted in the site-specific
ERA to determine if the facility or activity continues to operate
within its predicted environmental performance</li>
<li>be periodically reviewed (in conjunction with the periodic
revision and update of the ERA) as to its adequacy for testing the
environmental predictions</li>
<li>be modified as necessary to support and assess the adequacy of
any adaptive management measures</li>
</ul>
<p>Environmental monitoring may involve three basic types of
monitoring objectives (see CSA N288.4 [4]):</p>
<ul>
<li>pathways monitoring</li>
<li>biological effects monitoring</li>
<li>supplementary studies</li>
</ul>
<p>Pathways monitoring is the most common form of monitoring. It
involves sampling and analyzing abiotic and biotic media that lie
along the pathways connecting a source (that is, a release from a
facility or activity) to a receptor (such as non-human biota or the
public) to determine the concentration or level of a contaminant or
physical stressor in that medium. This data, combined with
environmental transfer parameters that describe the movement of
contaminants or physical stressors through the environment, may be
used to assess the exposure of the receptor. Some examples of the
most common sampling media are:</p>
<ul>
<li>components of air, water, soil and sediment</li>
<li>vegetation consumed by herbivorous receptors</li>
<li>tissues of prey animals consumed by carnivorous receptors</li>
<li>foodstuffs consumed by humans</li>
</ul>
<p>Such environmental monitoring is only necessary for those
facilities or activities where the releases have the potential to
be measurable within the environment. The monitoring details, with
respect to the analytes being measured (physical stressors, nuclear
and hazardous substances) and the media to be sampled (air, water,
and so on), are dependent on the scale and complexity of the risks
associated with the facility or activity.</p>
<p>Biological effects monitoring is used to detect actual
measurable biological responses of organisms to exposure to the
stressor. For regulatory purposes, responses at the individual,
population or community level of biological organization are
considered to be more relevant as indicators of ecological effects.
Some examples of biological effects monitoring that may be relevant
depending on the risk posed by the facility or activity
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>toxicity testing using exposure media (such as effluent
receiving waters or exposed sediments)</li>
<li>fish health and population indicators (such as gonadal somatic
index and egg production)</li>
<li>monitoring of plant or benthic invertebrate community
composition (benthic invertebrates or plants)</li>
</ul>
<p>Supplementary studies may be conducted to achieve specific
well-defined objectives such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>providing the data required to reduce uncertainty and
confounding factors in the ERA</li>
<li>increasing knowledge of the behavior of contaminants and
physical stressors in the environment (for example, refining
environmental transfer parameters)</li>
<li>investigating monitoring results that indicate potential
deviation from the transport or effects predictions in the ERA or
the licensing basis</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sec-4.4">4.4 Public dose</h3>
<p>Radiological releases to the environment are controlled and
monitored by the effluent and emissions control and monitoring and
the environmental monitoring. Results of these monitoring and
control activities are used to determine dose to members of the
public.</p>
<p>A human health risk assessment (HHRA) is completed as a
sub-element of an ERA for both nuclear and hazardous
substances.</p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>The <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em> define prescribed
dose limits for workers and members of the public, and require
doses to be monitored by direct measurement or by estimation of the
quantities and concentrations of any nuclear substance released as
a result of a licensed activity.</p>
<p>The <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em> require licensees
to implement a radiation protection program for protection of the
public. The focus for radiation protection within the environmental
protection framework is on radiological protection of the
environment and the public.</p>
<h4>Guidance</h4>
<p>The development of a radiation protection program should be
based on a sound policy, strategy and method for radiation
protection and the achievement of ALARA, while taking into
consideration the pathways and critical groups identified in the
derived release limits (DRL) document (CSA N288.1, <em>Guidelines
for calculating derived release limits for radioactive material in
airborne and liquid effluents for normal operation of nuclear
facilities</em> [3]).</p>
<p>The licensee should design the radiation protection program
commensurate with the radiological hazards associated with the
licensed activities, based on an ERA and including radiation
exposure and dose assessments.</p>
<h3 id="sec-4.5">4.5 Groundwater protection and monitoring</h3>
<p>Groundwater protection is a specialized element of the overall
environmental protection measures. As groundwater flow and
associated contaminant transport can be more difficult to detect
and delineate than that of surface water, specific requirements and
guidance are provided here.</p>
<p>Groundwater protection is an inter-related system of
initiatives, processes and activities with the overall goal of
protecting the quality and quantity of groundwater by minimizing
interactions with the environment from activities associated with a
nuclear facility, allowing for effective management of groundwater
resources.</p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>For Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills, the
licensee shall ensure that the need for and design of groundwater
protection programs and associated monitoring address CSA N288.7,
<em>Groundwater protection programs at Class I nuclear facilities
and uranium mines and mills</em> [7].</p>
<p>The applicant or licensee shall implement a groundwater
protection program in a graded approach, appropriate to their
circumstances, to:</p>
<ul>
<li>prevent or minimize releases of nuclear or hazardous substances
to groundwater</li>
<li>prevent or minimize the effects of physical stressors on
groundwater end uses</li>
<li>confirm that adequate measures are in place to stop, contain,
control and monitor any releases and physical stressors that can
occur under normal operation</li>
</ul>
<h4>Guidance</h4>
<p>For facilities or activities other than Class I nuclear
facilities and uranium mines and mills, for which the CNSC has
determined that there are direct interactions with the environment,
the applicant or licensee should implement a groundwater protection
program and associated monitoring program in accordance with CSA
N288.7, <em>Groundwater protection programs at Class I nuclear
facilities and uranium mines and mills</em> [7] in a graded
approach as appropriate to their circumstances.
<strong>Note:</strong> Although CSA N288.7 [7] was developed for
Class I facilities and uranium mines and mills, the methodology and
general principles can be applied to other facilities and
activities regulated by the CNSC.</p>
<p>Groundwater protection programs are developed on a site-specific
basis and should consider the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>identification of sources of contaminants of concern</li>
<li>investigation of releases under normal operation and source
characterization</li>
<li>site characterization</li>
<li>assessment of groundwater end use</li>
<li>assessment of groundwater vulnerability</li>
<li>development of a groundwater monitoring program</li>
<li>risk management (as required)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sec-4.6">4.6 Environmental management system</h3>
<p>An environmental management system (EMS) refers to the
management of an organization's environmental policies, measures
and procedures in a comprehensive, systematic, planned and
documented manner. It includes the organizational structure,
planning and resources for developing, implementing and maintaining
policy for environmental protection and for continuous improvement
by:</p>
<ul>
<li>identifying and managing environmental risks associated with a
facility or activity (see section 3 and section 4.1)</li>
<li>the identification, implementation and maintenance of pollution
control activities and technologies (see section 4.2.1)</li>
<li>monitoring of releases (see section 4.2.2)</li>
<li>monitoring of contaminants and for their potential effects in
the environment (see section 4.3)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the EMS should address environmental emergency
preparedness.</p>
<p>The EMS serves as the management tool for integrating all of the
applicant or licensee's environmental protection measures in a
documented, managed and auditable process by:</p>
<ul>
<li>identifying and managing non-compliances and corrective actions
within the activities, through internal and external inspections
and audits</li>
<li>summarizing and reporting the performance of these activities,
both internally (licensee's management structure) and externally
(to the Commission and the public)</li>
<li>training of the personnel involved in these activities</li>
<li>ensuring the availability of resources (such as qualified
personnel, organizational infrastructure, technology and financial
resources)</li>
<li>defining and delegating roles, responsibilities and authorities
essential to effective environmental management</li>
</ul>
<p>The EMS may be implemented within the licensee's integrated
management system.</p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>For Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills, the
licensee shall manage their environmental protection measures
within an EMS that reflects the nature and complexity of their
environmental protection measures.</p>
<p>The licensee shall:</p>
<ul>
<li>establish, implement and maintain an EMS that meets the
requirements set by CAN/CSA ISO 14001, <em>Environmental Management
Systems – Requirements with Guidance for Use</em> (2004 edition or
successor editions) [1, 2]</li>
<li>ensure that the scope of the EMS is consistent with the
definition of environment, environmental effects and pollution
prevention provided in the glossary of this regulatory
document</li>
<li>conduct internal audits at planned intervals so that all
elements of the EMS are audited on at least a five-year cycle</li>
<li>conduct an annual management review</li>
</ul>
<h4>Guidance</h4>
<p>For facilities or activities other than Class I nuclear
facilities and uranium mines and mills, for which the CNSC has
determined that there are direct interactions with the environment,
the applicant or licensee should manage their environmental
protection measures within an EMS that reflects the nature and
complexity of their environmental protection measures.</p>
<p>In addition to the information provided in this regulatory
document, the licensee should refer to the following documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>CAN/CSA ISO 14001, <em>Environmental Management Systems –
Requirements with Guidance for Use</em> (2004 edition or successor
editions) [1, 2]</li>
<li>CAN/CSA ISO 14004, <em>Environmental Management Systems –
General Guidelines on Principles, Systems and Support
Techniques</em> [14]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The CNSC does not consider certification
to CAN/CSA ISO 14001 by an authorized registrar or other
independent third party as solely sufficient for demonstrating
compliance with the requirements. The CNSC evaluates all activities
in relation to the requirements of this regulatory document. The
CNSC's compliance verification focuses on the effectiveness of the
EMS rather than on the licensee's adherence to CAN/CSA ISO 14001
(2004 edition or successor editions) [1, 2].</p>
<p>During the design of an EMS, the ISO documents provide guidance
and information that may be useful; however, the licensee should
note that, as a federal agency, the CNSC has adopted certain key
concepts in environmental protection from other federal statutes.
Where applicable, the CNSC expects licensees to apply the
more-demanding meanings from federal legislation in the scope of
their EMS.</p>
<p>To avoid misinterpretation of these concepts, the licensee
should review the following differences between key concepts in
federal legislation and those in CAN/CSA ISO 14001 (2004 edition or
successor editions) [1, 2] and consider them in the scope of their
EMS:</p>
<ul>
<li>the CNSC's definitions of environment, environmental effect
(i.e., impact) and pollution prevention (i.e., prevention of
pollution) in this regulatory document are taken from federal
legislation and are broader than the definitions of the related
terms in CAN/CSA ISO 14001 (2004 edition or successor editions) [1,
2]</li>
<li>in both the NSCA and the <em>Canadian Environmental Protection
Act, 1999</em> (CEPA 1999), risk is a key concept in environmental
protection that is not addressed in CAN/CSA ISO 14001 [1, 2]</li>
<li>the licensee should use the ERA as one of the core sources to
inform the significant environmental aspects and effects of the
EMS</li>
<li>CAN/CSA ISO 14001 [1, 2] provides only minimal guidance on the
interpretation of adverse environmental effects</li>
</ul>
<p>Pollution prevention is the key principle underlying the
management of hazardous substances in Canada. Section 64 of CEPA
1999 defines the nature of toxic substances, explicitly defining
unreasonable risk for certain scheduled substances. For other
potentially hazardous substances that are not subject to
legislation, unreasonable risk may be interpreted in terms of
likely significant adverse effects. This concept is nearly
equivalent to the CAN/CSA ISO 14001 [1, 2] concept of significant
environmental effects. In the CNSC licensing process for Class I
nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills, an EA under the
NSCA or CEAA 2012 process provides an initial framework for
identifying and assessing the equivalent of ISO-significant
environmental aspects in an appropriate context. This information
can provide the initial foundation for the scope of the EMS.</p>
<p>For nuclear substances, the <em>Radiation Protection
Regulations</em> require exposure and doses to persons to be
managed according to the ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable)
principle, while taking social and economic factors into account.
G-129, <em>Keeping Radiation Exposures and Doses "As Low As
Reasonably Achievable (ALARA)"</em> [8] provides additional
information.</p>
<p>The <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em> define risk for
workers and the public through prescribed dose limits, and require
doses to be monitored by direct measurement or by estimation of the
quantities and concentrations of any nuclear substance released as
a result of the licensed activity.</p>
<p>The EMS framework should cover the assessment of releases and
potential effects, the measures to control releases of nuclear
substances and hazardous substances into the environment, and the
measures taken to prevent or mitigate potential effects.</p>
<p>The framework should be appropriate for the type of facility or
activity and the licensing phase, and should be commensurate with
overall regulatory requirements. In addition to the environmental
protection measures described in detail earlier, the EMS should
address environmental emergency preparedness.</p>
<h4>Environmental emergency preparedness</h4>
<p>The licensee should address environmental emergency preparedness
and response in terms of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the proposed measures to prevent or mitigate the effects of
accidental releases of nuclear and hazardous substances on the
environment</li>
<li>the proposed measures to ensure the availability and
accessibility of environmental monitoring instrumentation during
emergencies</li>
<li>the inclusion of environmental monitoring instrumentation and
equipment layouts in emergency plans</li>
</ul>
<p>The licensee should address reporting requirements for potential
or real emergency situations.</p>
<p>For additional guidance, refer to REGDOC-2.10.1, <em>Nuclear
Emergency Preparedness and Response</em> [15].</p>
<h4>Other considerations</h4>
<p>The licensee should describe elements of the EMS related to
worker training or qualifications, and the environmental protection
obligations of workers. The licensee should demonstrate how
training programs will enable workers to meet their obligations
with respect to environmental protection.</p>

<h2 id="app-a">Appendix A: Environmental Assessments Under CEAA
2012</h2>
<p>The CNSC ensures that the environmental assessment (EA)
requirements of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012
(CEAA 2012) are met for designated projects (described in CEAA
2012) that are regulated under the Nuclear Safety and Control Act
(NSCA)</p>
<p>An EA under CEAA 2012:</p>
<ul>
<li>predicts the environmental effects of a proposed designated
project</li>
<li>identifies mitigation measures</li>
<li>assesses whether the proposed project is likely to cause
significant adverse environmental effects, taking into account the
identified mitigation measures</li>
<li>ensures a follow up program is developed to verify the accuracy
of the EA predictions under CEAA 2012 and the effectiveness of any
mitigation measures</li>
</ul>
<p>An EA conducted under CEAA 2012 is a planning tool. It is
carried out early in the licensing process (before any licence is
granted) and considers the entire proposed lifecycle of a project.
An EA under CEAA 2012 includes information prepared by the
applicant and CNSC staff, as well as comments received from
Aboriginal groups and the public. After reviewing the EA, the
Commission determines if the proposed project is likely to cause
significant adverse environmental effects, taking into
consideration the implementation of mitigation measures.</p>
<p>In accordance with paragraph 15(a) of CEAA 2012, the CNSC is the
sole federal responsible authority (RA) for conducting an EA for
designated projects regulated under the NSCA and described in the

<p>The Minister of Environment and Climate Change Canada may also
designate a physical activity that is not prescribed by the
<em>Regulations Designating Physical Activities</em> if the project
may cause adverse environmental effects or if there are public
concerns related to those effects.</p>
<p>For these designated projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>the CNSC must make an EA decision in accordance with section 52
of CEAA 2012 before a regulatory decision can be made under the
NSCA to allow the project to proceed</li>
<li>if the CNSC determines that the project is not likely to cause
significant adverse environmental effects in accordance with
subsection 52(1) of CEAA 2012, then in accordance with section 53
and through the licensing process, the CNSC establishes the
mitigation measures and, where applicable, follow up activities
that the applicant must implement</li>
<li>if the CNSC determines that the project is likely to cause
significant adverse environmental effects, then in accordance with
section 52(2) of CEAA 2012, the CNSC will refer to the Governor in
Council the matter of whether those effects are justified in the

</ul>
<p>Licensing, compliance and verification activities undertaken by
CNSC staff ensure that the applicant has implemented the mitigation
measures identified in the EA. Where applicable, the licensing,
compliance and verification activities will also be used to ensure
the implementation of a follow-up program.</p>
<p>If an applicant proposes to carry on an activity following the
completion of an EA under CEAA 2012, the applicant must complete
the CNSC licensing process, including safety and control measures
for protection of the environment and of the health and safety of
persons.</p>
<h3 id="app-a.1">A.1 Environmental assessment under CEAA 2012
conducted by the CNSC</h3>
<p>The applicant chooses whether to complete an EA under CEAA 2012
via an integrated approach with the CNSC licensing process, or a
sequential approach.</p>
<p>Under an integrated approach, the EA is conducted at the same
time as the review of the information in the applicant's licence
application, enabling CNSC staff to present their recommendations
for the EA and the licence application to the Commission at the
same Commission proceeding (for example, a meeting, a hearing or an
abridged hearing).,/</p>
<p>Under a sequential approach, the EA is conducted first, with a

more appropriate when, for example, an applicant uses the EA to
assess the feasibility of a project.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>after the EA is completed, the applicant is responsible for
submitting all remaining documentation to fulfill the CNSC's
licensing requirements to undertake project activities</li>
<li>if sufficient time elapses between the EA decision and the
submission of the corresponding licence application that there is
new science and/or technology, new policy, changes in the
environment, or any project modifications with a potentially
different impact on the environment, CNSC staff may require the
applicant to update the previous EA information to take into
account these additional considerations</li>
</ul>
<p>CEAA 2012 does not set regulated timelines for EAs conducted by
the CNSC. However (pursuant to the <em>Class I Nuclear Facilities
Regulations and the Uranium Mines and Mills Regulations</em>), the
CNSC is committed to completing this process within the 24 month
federal timeline for a licensing decision under the integrated
approach. Furthermore, CNSC staff's service standard for completing
an EA under CEAA 2012 under a sequential approach is also a 24
month federal timeline. Adherence to this schedule, for both
integrated and sequential approaches, is facilitated by the
completeness of information received from applicants, and the
process will begin when the notice of commencement is posted.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The 24 month federal timeline applies to
CNSC activities, and not to the time periods required for steps
outside the CNSC's control, such as time the applicant needs to
prepare technical studies or to respond to requests for additional
information or circumstances that are specific to the project.</p>

<h3 id="app-a.2">A.2 Key steps for an environmental assessment
under CEAA 2012</h3>
<p>The process for an EA conducted by the CNSC under CEAA 2012
includes the following key steps.</p>
<h4>Step 1: Applicant conducts pre-project engagement with the
CNSC</h4>
<p>Applicants may begin to determine the feasibility of a project
before submitting a project description and (for an integrated
approach) a licence application. Early communication with the CNSC
is recommended, to help applicants:</p>
<ul>
<li>identify projects that must undergo an EA in accordance with
CEAA 2012</li>
<li>understand the regulatory requirements</li>
<li>understand the CNSC's EA and licensing processes (that is, an
integrated EA compared to a sequential EA) and the associated
anticipated timelines</li>
<li>clarify the information to be included in the project
description</li>
<li>identify the potential involvement of other jurisdictions</li>
<li>identify Aboriginal groups whose Aboriginal or treaty rights
may be affected or Aboriginal groups with an interest in the
project</li>
<li>determine the appropriate level of public and Aboriginal
engagement activities</li>
</ul>
<p>To facilitate planning, the CNSC encourages applicants and
licensees to submit their project descriptions as early as
possible.</p>
<p>The CNSC may allow some applicants to apply a graded approach to
the requirements for a project description as set out in the
<em>Prescribed Information for the Description of a Designated
Project Regulations</em>. This possibility should be discussed and
determined during pre-project engagement.</p>
<p>For early engagement and planning purposes, the CNSC may
initiate early discussions with other federal, provincial or
territorial authorities and Aboriginal groups as soon as an
applicant indicates their intent to seek regulatory approval for a
proposed project. The objective of early engagement is to support a
more timely and efficient process for the EA under CEAA 2012. For
more information, see step 4, below.</p>
<h4>Step 2: Applicant submits a project description and/or licence
application</h4>
<p>For a sequential approach applied to a proposed new facility
(that requires a new licence application), the applicant submits
both of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a project description that provides the information set out in
the <em>Prescribed Information for the Description of a Designated
Project Regulations</em></li>
<li>an initial licence application with the necessary information
needed to start the EA process, and a schedule for submission of
the remaining material</li>
</ul>
<p>For a sequential approach applied to an existing facility with
proposed new activities (that requires a licence amendment), the
applicant submits a project description only.</p>
<p>For an integrated approach, the applicant submits both of the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a project description that provides the information set out in
the <em>Prescribed Information for the Description of a Designated
Project Regulations</em></li>
<li>a licence application</li>
</ul>
<p>The CNSC may request additional information, even if the project
description generally conforms to these regulations, as required to
complete the EA determination.</p>
<h4>Step 3: CNSC determines if an EA under CEAA 2012 is
required</h4>
<p>A nuclear project undergoes an EA under CEAA 2012 if it meets
the description of a designated project in the <em>Regulations
Designating Physical Activities</em> or if it has been designated
by the Minister of Environment and Climate Change Canada. Using the
information provided in the project description, the CNSC
determines if the project is a designated project, and completes an
EA determination memorandum that documents the findings.</p>
<p>If an EA under CEAA 2012 is required, the CNSC informs the
applicant.</p>
<p>If an EA under CEAA 2012 is not required, the applicant must
still meet CNSC licensing requirements before the licence is
issued, including submission of information that allows CNSC staff
to conduct an EA under the NSCA to ensure the applicant or licensee
will, in carrying out the project, ensure the protection of the
environment and of the health of persons, as described in section
3.</p>
<p>For an EA under CEAA 2012:</p>
<ul>
<li>As the sole federal responsible authority for nuclear projects,
the CNSC contacts provincial jurisdictions to determine if there
are any other provincial EA requirements. Where applicable, the
CNSC works with other jurisdictions to determine if their EA
requirements can be addressed through a single EA process (to
reduce duplication and provide regulatory efficiency). Relevant
federal and provincial EA agreements provide direction regarding
jurisdictional roles and responsibilities in the assessment of such
projects.</li>
<li>The CNSC may delegate the conduct of an EA or any part thereof
to another jurisdiction. In such cases, the responsibility for
making a decision under subsection 52(1) of CEAA 2012 remains with
the Commission. Delegation of EA related matters for a given
project are determined on a case-by-case basis in accordance with
section 26 of CEAA 2012.</li>
<li>The CNSC contacts other federal authorities to determine if
additional regulatory decisions are required to allow the project
to proceed. The CNSC also engages the appropriate federal
authorities to determine whether they can provide specialist or
expert information or knowledge to support the conduct of the
EA.</li>
<li>The CNSC ensures that a notice of commencement of an EA is
posted on the Canadian Environmental Assessment Registry (CEAR).
This notice provides a brief description of the project, the
jurisdictions involved, and CNSC contact information. The CNSC
posts a similar notice on the CNSC website, and provides a link to
the notice of commencement on CEAR. The CNSC also distributes the
notice to its subscription list and sends a formal notice to
identified Aboriginal groups.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 4: Defining participation opportunities</h4>
<p>Aboriginal consultation activities are integrated in the EA
process to the extent possible. For more information, see
REGDOC-3.2.2, <em>Aboriginal Engagement</em> [10].</p>
<p>The CNSC ensures that the public is provided with an opportunity
to participate in the EA. The breadth and timing of public
participation is at the discretion of the CNSC. For example, a
public review period may be conducted on the project description to
solicit the views of the public, Aboriginal groups and other
stakeholders to help inform the conduct of the EA under CEAA 2012.
Other opportunities could include public outreach sessions (such as
open houses or information sessions); a public review on
documentation (such as the environmental impact statement (EIS) or
EA report); or participation in a public hearing on the EA.</p>
<h4>Step 5: Determining the scope of the EA</h4>
<p>Under subsection 19(1) of CEAA 2012, the CNSC is required to
consider certain factors in the EA under CEAA 2012 (see subsection
A.3). The Commission determines the scope of these factors in a
Commission proceeding.</p>
<p>CNSC staff will notify the applicant of the final scope of
factors determined by the Commission, including any additional
requirements that are to be included in the conduct of the
technical studies and EIS.</p>
<h4>Step 6: Applicant conducts technical studies and submits the
EIS</h4>
<p>The conduct of the technical studies and preparation of an EIS
are typically delegated to the applicant. The document <em>Generic
Guidelines for the Preparation of an Environmental Impact
Statement</em> pursuant to the Canadian Environmental Assessment
Act, 2012 [16] informs applicants of the information requirements
for the preparation of an EIS for a project that requires an EA
under CEAA 2012.</p>
<p>The applicant submits the EIS and any supporting technical
studies to the CNSC for a technical review.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To meet CEAA 2012 requirements, the
applicant should complete a baseline environmental characterization
(see appendix B), and an environmental effects characterization
(see appendix C). Specific requirements under CEAA 2012 are
described in subsection A.3.</p>
<h4>Step 7: Technical review of the EIS</h4>
<p>CNSC staff and, where applicable, other federal and provincial
authorities perform an in depth technical review of the EIS and
supporting technical studies. If certain areas need to be
clarified, confirmed or improved based on the technical review, the
CNSC may ask the applicant to provide additional information to
resolve these issues.</p>
<p>When CNSC staff are satisfied that the applicant has adequately
addressed all information gaps, the technical review is considered
to be complete.</p>
<h4>Step 8: EA report</h4>
<p>The CNSC must ensure that an EA report is prepared. The EA
report includes CNSC staff's conclusions regarding the potential
environment effects, the proposed mitigation measures, and whether
the project is likely to result in significant adverse
environmental effects, as well as follow-up program
requirements.</p>
<p>CNSC staff draft the EA report, which synthesizes the
applicant's technical information and takes into account the
results of the technical review, including any comments received
from other parties.</p>
<p>The CNSC may request other federal agencies to review the EA
report or to provide expert information or knowledge. Comments
received will be considered in the development of the EA
report.</p>
<h4>Step 9: Commission proceeding on the EA report</h4>
<p>CNSC staff prepare a document summarizing the EA report's
conclusions and recommendations, and outlining the EA-related
decisions that the Commission needs to make. This document and the
EA report are submitted to the Commission, along with any public
comments received (including how the CNSC staff addressed the
comments). The Commission uses this information to inform its
decision.</p>
<p>For public hearings, a notice of public Commission hearing is
posted on the CNSC website at least 60 days before the scheduled
hearing to inform the public and Aboriginal groups with hearing
information, including information on how to intervene at the
hearing. The CNSC also sends a copy of the notice to identified
Aboriginal groups. This procedure enables interested parties to
request intervenor status from the Commission for the public
hearing and to send their comments on the EA report.</p>
<p>Public hearings are usually held at the CNSC headquarters in
Ottawa, but the Commission may decide to hold such a hearing in a
community in the vicinity of the proposed project.</p>
<p>The exact nature of the public hearing depends on whether the
project is following an integrated or sequential EA and licensing
process. This information is provided in the notice of public
Commission proceeding.</p>
<p>Where other federal authorities provided expert information or
knowledge during the conduct of the EA under CEAA 2012, the
Commission may request their participation in the public
hearing.</p>
<p>Following the public hearing, the Commission makes a decision,
based on the EA, on whether the project is likely to cause
significant adverse environmental effects, taking into account
mitigation measures that were identified during the EA. This
decision must be made before a licensing decision can be made on
allowing the project to proceed.</p>
<p>If the Commission concludes that a project is not likely to
cause significant adverse environmental effects in accordance with
subsection 52(1) of CEAA 2012, the Commission (in accordance with
section 53) must establish through the licensing process, the
mitigation measures and follow-up activities that the applicant
must implement.</p>
<p>If the Commission concludes that a project is likely to cause
significant adverse environmental effects in accordance with
subsection 52(2) of CEAA 2012, the Commission refers to the
Governor in Council the matter of whether those effects are
justified in the circumstances.</p>
<p>The Commission's decision is published on the CNSC website and
the CEAR. Aboriginal groups and members of the public who have
expressed an interest in a particular project may be directly
notified of the decision.</p>
<p class="text-right"><a href="#wb-main">Top of page</a></p>
<h3 id="app-a.3">A.3 Specific CEAA 2012 environmental assessment
requirements</h3>
<p>Where the information is common to both the EIS and the licence
application, the applicant may provide the information in either
the application or the EIS, with appropriate cross-referencing
between the submissions. The applicant shall clearfixly indicate
where the requirements of both the NSCA and CEAA 2012 are
addressed.</p>
<p>The EA of a designated project shall take into account the
following factors as listed in subsection 19(1) of CEAA 2012:</p>
<ol class="list-bullet-none">
<li>a) the environmental effects of the designated project,
including the environmental effects of malfunctions or accidents
that may occur in connection with the designated project and any
cumulative environmental effects that are likely to results from
the designated project in combination with other physical
activities that have been or will be carried out</li>
<li>b) the significance of those environmental effects</li>
<li>c) comments from the public that are received in accordance
with CEAA 2012</li>
<li>d) mitigation measures that are technically and economically
feasible and that would mitigate any significant adverse
environmental effects of the designated project</li>
<li>e) the requirements of the follow up program in respect of the
designated project</li>
<li>f) the purpose of the designated project</li>
<li>g) alternative means of carrying out the designated project
that are technically and economically feasible and the
environmental effects of any such alternative means</li>
<li>h) any changes to the designated project that may be caused by
the environment</li>
<li>i) the results of any relevant study conducted by a committee
established under section 73 or 74 of CEAA 2012</li>
<li>j) any other matter relevant to the EA that the responsible
authority requires to be taken into account</li>
</ol>
<p>Pursuant to subsection 19(2) of CEAA 2012, the scope of the
factors to be taken into account under paragraphs 19(1)(a), (b),
(d), (e), (g), (h) and (j) is determined by the Commission, as a
responsible authority.</p>
<p>The EIS and supporting technical studies are completed to meet
the requirements of CEAA 2012, paragraphs 19(1)(a), (b), (d), (e),
(f), (g), (h) and, if appropriate, (i) and (j) in accordance with
the scope of these factors as determined by the CNSC. The
completion of the EIS and, as necessary, supporting technical
studies is typically delegated to the applicant in accordance with
section 23 of CEAA 2012. This regulatory document provides
requirements and guidance to support project planning and early
development of these documents by the applicant. These requirements
and guidance do not negate the importance of pre project engagement
or the potential for project-specific EA guidelines.</p>
<h4>A.3.1 Purpose of the project</h4>
<p>Paragraph 19(1)(f) of CEAA 2012 states that the EIS shall
identify the purpose of the project (defined as what is to be
achieved by carrying out the project).</p>
<p>For further guidance, consult Addressing "Purpose of" and
"Alternative Means" under the <em>Canadian Environmental Assessment
Act, 2012</em> [17].</p>
<h4>A.3.2 Alternative means for carrying out the project</h4>
<p>Paragraph 19(1)(g) of CEAA 2012 states that the EIS shall
identify and describe alternative means to carry out the project
that are, from the perspective of the applicant, technically and
economically feasible. As identified by the proponent, the
alternative means include options for locations, development, and
implementation methods, routes, designs, technologies, mitigation
measures, and so on. Alternative means may also be related to the
construction, operation, expansion, decommissioning and abandonment
of a physical work.</p>
<p>The approach and level of effort applied to addressing
alternative means is established on a project-by-project basis
taking into consideration:</p>
<ul>
<li>the characteristics of the project</li>
<li>the environmental effects associated with the potential
alternative means</li>
<li>the health or status of valued components (VCs) that may be
impacted by the alternative means</li>
<li>the potential for mitigation and the extent to which mitigation
measures may address potential environmental effects</li>
<li>the level of concern expressed by the public and Aboriginal
groups</li>
</ul>
<p>The EIS should also describe the environmental effects of each
alternative means. The criteria used to identify alternative means
as unacceptable, and how these criteria were applied, should be
described, as should the criteria used to examine the environmental
effects of each remaining alternative means to identify the
preferred alternative.</p>
<p>For further guidance, consult Addressing "Purpose of" and
"Alternative Means" under the <em>Canadian Environmental Assessment
Act, 2012</em> [17].</p>
<h4>A.3.3 Environmental effects</h4>
<p>Paragraph 19(1)(a) of CEAA 2012 states that the EA must take
into account the environmental effects of the designated
project.</p>
<p>The environmental effects that must be considered in an EA under
CEAA 2012 are also requirements under the NSCA. As described in
section 4, the applicant should conduct an ERA in accordance with
CSA 288.6, <em>Environmental risk assessment at Class I nuclear
facilities and uranium mines and mills</em> [6].</p>
<h4>A.3.4 Malfunctions and accidents</h4>
<p>Paragraph 19(1)(a) of CEAA 2012 states that malfunctions and
accidents shall be assessed in the EA. Malfunctions and accidents
should be separated into radiological and non-radiological
(conventional).</p>
<p>The applicant should provide an assessment of potential health
and environmental effects resulting from postulated radiological
and conventional malfunctions or accidents. The EIS should also
include any mitigation measures such as monitoring, contingency,
clean up or restoration work in the surrounding environment that
would be required during or immediately following the postulated
malfunction and accident scenarios.</p>
<p>The EIS should provide a description of postulated malfunction
and accident sequences leading to a radiological or
non-radiological release considering, as appropriate, internal
events, external events and human-induced events, including their
frequency and an explanation of how these events were identified,
and any modeling that was performed.</p>
<p>The applicant can use a bounding approach or use facility- or
activity-specific information (for example, design, operation,
projected environmental releases) in the assessment of radiological
accidents and malfunctions. If a bounding approach is used, the
applicant should provide a detailed rationale for the selection of
each bounding scenario.</p>
<p>The EIS should include the source, quantity, mechanism, pathway,
rate, form and characteristics of contaminants and other materials
(physical and chemical) likely to be released to the surrounding
environment during the postulated malfunctions and accidents.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Malfunctions and accidents are reviewed
in depth under the NSCA for licensing purposes (for example, under
REGDOC-2.4.1, <em>Deterministic Safety Analysis</em> [18],
REGDOC-2.4.2, <em>Probabilistic Safety Assessments for Nuclear
Power Plants</em> [19] and RD-346, <em>Site Evaluation for New
Nuclear Power Plants</em> [20]). These scenarios should be taken
into consideration by the applicant when designing environmental
protection measures (see section 4).</p>
<p>If applicable, the applicant should use operating experience
(OPEX) to identify any past abnormal operations, accidents and
spills to the extent that they are relevant to the current
assessment for the purposes of identifying malfunction and accident
scenarios to be assessed.</p>
<h4>A.3.5 Cumulative effects</h4>
<p>Paragraph 19(1)(a) of CEAA 2012 states that the applicant shall
assess any residual adverse environmental effects of the project in
combination with other past, present or reasonably foreseeable
projects and/or activities within the study area.</p>
<p>The applicant should explain the approach and methods used to
identify and assess cumulative effects. The approach and methods
should be consistent with <em>Assessing Cumulative Environmental
Effects under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012</em>
[21].</p>
<h4>A.3.6 Significance of residual effects</h4>
<p>Paragraph 19(1)(b) of CEAA 2012 states that the applicant shall
assess the significance of any residual effects that persist,
taking into consideration the proposed mitigation measures. These
residual effects are identified during the ERA or a
characterization of the environmental effects.</p>
<p>In the EIS, the applicant should include a detailed analysis of
the significance of each residual effect. The applicant should
clearfixly explain the method and definitions used to describe the
level of the residual adverse effect (for example, low, medium, or
high) for each of the issues. The applicant should also describe
any cumulative environmental effects that are likely to result from
the designated project in combination with other physical
activities that have been or will be carried on and how these
levels were combined to reach an overall conclusion on the
significance of the adverse effects for each valued component
(VC).</p>
<h5>Guidance</h5>
<p>Some specific issues to be assessed are:</p>
<ul>
<li>magnitude of the effect</li>
<li>spatial extent of the effect</li>
<li>duration and frequency of the effect</li>
<li>degree to which the effect can be reversed or mitigated</li>
<li>ecological importance</li>
</ul>
<p>The method used to describe the level of the adverse effect
should be transparent and reproducible.</p>
<p>The EIS should identify additional criteria used to assign
significance ratings to any predicted adverse effects. It should
contain clearfix and sufficient information to enable the CNSC and
the public to understand and review the applicant's judgement of
the significance of effects. The applicant should define the terms
used to describe the level of significance. In assessing
significance against the criteria, the EIS should, where possible,
employ relevant existing regulatory documents, environmental
standards, guidelines or objectives such as prescribed maximum
levels of emissions or discharges of specific hazardous substances
into the environment or maximum acceptable levels of specific
hazardous substances in the environment.</p>
<h4>A.3.7 Socio-economic environment</h4>
<p>The applicant should characterize the socio-economic environment
and identify all indirect socio-economic effects.</p>
<p>An indirect effect is a secondary environmental effect that
occurs as a result of a change that a project may cause to the
environment. Paragraph 5(2)(b) of CEAA 2012 refers to any change to
the environment caused by the project on health and socio-economic
conditions, physical and cultural heritage, or any structure, site
or thing that is of historical, archaeological, paleontological or
architectural significance.</p>
<p>For additional guidance, refer to <em>Technical Guidance for
Assessing Physical and Cultural Heritage or any Structure, Site or
Thing that is of Historical, Archeological, Paleontological or
Architectural Significance under the Canadian Environment
Assessment Act, 2012</em> [22].</p>
<h4>A.3.8 Community and Aboriginal traditional knowledge</h4>
<p>Subsection 19(3) of CEAA 2012 states that community and
Aboriginal traditional knowledge may be considered in the EA. CNSC
staff will provide guidance to the applicant at the earliest
possible stage in the EA process concerning the extent to which
community and Aboriginal traditional knowledge shall be considered
in the EA.</p>
<p>For additional information, refer to:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Considering Aboriginal traditional knowledge in
environmental assessments conducted under the Canadian
Environmental Assessment Act, 2012</em> [23]</li>
<li>REGDOC-3.2.2, <em>Aboriginal Engagement</em> [10] (for further
information on the CNSC's expectations of applicants for Aboriginal
engagement)</li>
</ul>
<h4>A.3.9 Assessment of effects of the environment on the
project</h4>
<p>Paragraph 19(1)(h) of CEAA 2012 states that the EIS shall take
into account how the environment could adversely affect the
project. The applicant shall also take into account any potential
effects of climate change on the project, including an assessment
of whether the project might be sensitive to changes in climate
conditions during its lifecycle.</p>
<p>Some adverse environmental conditions are flooding, severe
weather, biophysical hazards (such as algae), geotechnical hazards
and seismic events.</p>
<h4>A.3.10 EA follow-up program</h4>
<p>Paragraph 19(1)(e) of CEAA 2012 states that the EIS shall
include a framework or preliminary program upon which EA follow up
actions will be managed throughout the life of the project.</p>
<p>The applicant should design the follow up program to verify the
accuracy of the EA predictions and to determine the effectiveness
of the measures implemented to mitigate the potential adverse
environmental effects of the project.</p>
<p>The applicant should also design the follow up program to
incorporate pre-project information that would provide the baseline
data; compliance data such as established environmental quality
critera; regulatory documents, standards or guidelines; and real
time data consisting of observed data gathered in the field. As
part of the follow up program, the applicant should describe the
compliance reporting methods to be used, including reporting
frequency, methods and format.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The CNSC, in collaboration with other
federal authorities (where applicable), verifies and monitors all
EA follow up activities through the CNSC licensing and compliance
process. EA follow up monitoring activities may be integrated
within the applicant's environmental protection measures.</p>
<p class="text-right"><a href="#wb-main">Top of page</a></p>
<h2 id="app-b">Appendix B: Characterization of the Baseline
Environment for an Environmental Assessment Under CEAA 2012</h2>
<p>For a new licence, the applicant should use the information in
this appendix to develop a characterization of the baseline
environment. During the lifecycle of the facility or activity, the
licensee should use this information to review and update the
characterization, and also use the information in appendix C to
document and predict the future environmental effects compared to
this baseline characterization.</p>
<p>For additional information, see appendix D for a sample matrix
for mapping the facility/activity-environmental-component
interactions.</p>
<h3 id="app-b.1">B.1 Atmospheric environment</h3>
<p>The atmospheric environment includes the climate conditions at
the site and in the local and regional study areas. It includes the
seasonal variations in weather conditions within the study areas,
to allow the assessment of effects on the facility or activity.</p>
<p>The applicant or licensee should provide a description of the
existing ambient air quality in the study areas, with emphasis on
characterizing radiological and non-radiological analytes.</p>
<p>The description should include meteorological information such
as air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, wind speed
and direction, atmospheric pressure, and solar radiation. It should
also include the occurrence of weather phenomena (for example,
lightning, temperature inversions and fog). Special consideration
should be given to the analysis of extreme and rare meteorological
phenomena (for example, tornadoes).Uncertainties should be
described and taken into account when discussing the reliability of
the information presented.</p>
<p>The description should also include current ambient daytime and
nighttime noise levels at the site and local study areas, and
include information on its source(s), geographic extent and
temporal variations. The description should provide ambient noise
levels for other areas that could be affected by the facility or
activity. Some examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>increased traffic along transportation corridors to and from
the site during construction</li>
<li>receptors at residences and sensitive sites (such as hospitals,
schools, daycare facilities, seniors' residences, and places of
worship)</li>
</ul>
<p>The applicant or licensee should describe the influence of
regional topography or other features that could affect weather
conditions in the study areas.</p>
<p>The baseline information should be sufficient to support the use
of an atmospheric dispersion model to conduct the site-specific ERA
and to support an assessment of the effects of the environment on
the project (for example, tornadoes).</p>
<h3 id="app-b.2">B.2 Surface water environment</h3>
<p>The surface water environment includes all surface water
features and hydrology that affect surface water at the site or in
the local and regional study areas. The applicant or licensee
should include delineation of drainage basins at appropriate
scales.</p>
<p>When documenting the water quality of all surface water, the
applicant or licensee should demonstrate the use of appropriate
sampling and analytical protocols, for the range of analytical
parameters with the potential to be influenced by the facility or
activity. This information should be presented using tables, maps

(2) However, if the carrying out of the physical activity, the
designated project or the project requires a federal authority to
exercise a power or perform a duty or function conferred on it
under any Act of Parliament other than this Act, the following
environmental effects are also to be taken into account:
<ol class="list-bullet-none">
<li>(a) a change, other than those referred to in paragraphs (1)(a)
and (b), that may be caused to the environment and that is directly
linked or necessarily incidental to a federal authority's exercise
of a power or performance of a duty or function that would permit
the carrying out, in whole or in part, of the physical activity,
the designated project or the project; and</li>
<li>(b) an effect, other than those referred to in paragraph
(1)(c), of any change referred to in paragraph (a) on
<ol class="list-bullet-none">
<li>(i) health and socio-economic conditions,</li>
<li>(ii) physical and cultural heritage, or</li>
<li>(iii) any structure, site or thing that is of historical,
archaeological, paleontological or architectural significance.</li>

<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>(évaluation des risques
environnementaux [ERE])</em></span></dt>
<dd>A process that identifies, quantifies and characterizes the
risk posed by contaminants (nuclear or hazardous substances) and
physical stressors in the environment. An ERA is a practice or
methodology primarily developed by regulatory agencies to provide
scientific input to decision makers. As such, ERAs commonly serve
as a supportive tool providing technical information in a
manageable form to a larger EA.</dd>
<dt><strong>licensing basis</strong> <span lang="fr" xml:lang=
"fr"><em>(fondement d'autorisation)</em></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>A set of requirements and documents for a regulated facility or
activity comprising:</p>

substances or energy that avoid or minimize the creation of
pollutants and waste and reduce the overall risk to the environment
or to human health. (Source: <em>Canadian Environmental Protection
Act, 1999</em>)<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Within pollution prevention, the CNSC also
includes, where necessary, the use of environmental controls to
prevent or minimize releases to the environment.</dd>
<dt><strong>polluter pays</strong> <span lang="fr" xml:lang=
"fr"><em>(pollueur-payeur)</em></span></dt>
<dd>A principle that is based on the concept that users and

<dd>Environmental features that may be affected by a project and
that have been identified to be of concern by the proponent,
government agencies, Aboriginal peoples or the public. The valud of
a component not only relates to its role in the ecosystem, but also
to the value people place on it. For example, it may have been
identified as having scientific, social, cultural, economic,
historical, archaeological or aesthetic importance. For the
purposes of CEAA 2012, valued components are selected in relation
to section 5 of CEAA 2012 and taking into account direction
provided by the responsible authority.(Source: <em>Practitioners

<strong>Note:</strong> VCs are selected from the abiotic and biotic
information collected as part of the baseline characterization.
They may be surrogate organisms rather than actual plant or animal
species (for example, a theoretical benthic feeding fish species),
communities (for example, a benthic macroinvertebrate community) or
specific species (for example, an endangered species), but may also
include significant ecological features of the environment, such as
wetlands.</dd>

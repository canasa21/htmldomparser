<title>REGDOC-2.4.2, Probabilistic Safety Assessment (PSA) for
Nuclear Power Plants</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>This regulatory document is part of the CNSC's Safety Analysis
series of regulatory documents. The full list of regulatory
document series is included in the back of this document and can be
found on the <a href=
"http://www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/acts-and-regulations/regulatory-documents/index.cfm">
CNSC's website</a>.</p>
<p>This regulatory document sets out the requirements of the
Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) with respect to the
probabilistic safety assessment.</p>
<p>Issued as REGDOC-2.4.2, this document is the second version of
<em>Probabilistic Safety Assessment (PSA) for Nuclear Power
Plants</em>. It supersedes the previous version of the same title
that was identified asS–294. REGDOC-2.4.2 includes amendments to
reflect lessons learned from the Fukushima nuclear event of March
2011, and to address findings from the <em>CNSC Fukushima Task
Force Report</em>, as applicable toS–294.</p>
<p>REGDOC-2.4.2 is intended to form part of the licensing basis for
a regulated facility or activity within the scope of the document.
It is intended for inclusion in licences, either as part of the
conditions and safety and control measures in a licence, or as part
of the safety and control measures to be described in a licence
application and the documents needed to support that
application.</p>
<p>For proposed new facilities: This document will be used to
assess new licence applications for reactor facilities.</p>
<p>Guidance contained in this document exists to inform the
applicant, to elaborate further on requirements or to provide
direction to licensees and applicants on how to meet requirements.
It also provides more information about how CNSC staff evaluate
specific problems or data during their review of licence
applications. Licensees are expected to review and consider
guidance; should they choose not to follow it, they should explain
how their chosen alternate approach meets regulatory
requirements.</p>
<p>For existing facilities: The requirements contained in this
document do not apply unless they have been included, in whole or
in part, in the licence or licensing basis.</p>
<p>A graded approach, commensurate with risk, may be defined and
used when applying the requirements and guidance contained in this
regulatory document. The use of a graded approach is not a
relaxation of requirements. With a graded approach, the application
of requirements is commensurate with the risks and particular
characteristics of the facility or activity.</p>
<p>An applicant or licensee may put forward a case to demonstrate
that the intent of a requirement is addressed by other means and
demonstrated with supportable evidence.</p>
<p>The requirements and guidance in this document are consistent
with modern national and international practices addressing issues
and elements that control and enhance nuclear safety. In
particular, they establish a modern, risk-informed approach to the
categorization of accidents – one that considers a full spectrum of
possible events, including events of greatest consequence to the
public.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info module-simplify">
<p><strong>Important note:</strong> Where referenced in a licence
either directly or indirectly (such as through licensee-referenced
documents), this document is part of the licensing basis for a
regulated facility or activity.</p>
<p>The licensing basis sets the boundary conditions for acceptable
performance at a regulated facility or activity and establishes the
basis for the CNSC's compliance program for that regulated facility
or activity.</p>

<h2 id="sec1">1. Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="sec1-1">1.1 Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of this regulatory document, when incorporated into
a licence to construct or operate a nuclear power plant (NPP) or
other legally enforceable instrument, is to assure that the
licensee conducts a probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) in
accordance with defined requirements.</p>
<h3 id="sec1-2">1.2 Scope</h3>
<p>This document sets out the requirements for the PSA for a
licence to construct or operate an NPP, when required by the
applicable licence or other legally enforceable instrument.</p>
<h3 id="sec1-3">1.3 Relevant legislation</h3>
<p>The <em>Nuclear Safety Control Act</em> (NSCA) and its
regulations do not contain explicit references to PSA for NPPs.
However, the following provisions are relevant to this
document:</p>
<ul>
<li>Section 3 of the NSCA, which sets out the purpose of the Act,
provides for "the limitation to a reasonable level and in a manner
that is consistent with Canada's international obligations of the
risks to national security, the health and safety of persons and
the environment that are associated with the development,
production and use of nuclear energy".</li>
<li>Subsection 24(4) of the NSCA stipulates that "No licence may be
issued, renewed, amended or replaced unless, in the opinion of the
Commission, the applicant
<ul class="list-lower-alpha">
<li>is qualified to carry on the activity that the licence
authorizes the licensee to carry on; and</li>
<li>will, in carrying on that activity, make adequate provision for
the protection of the environment, the health and safety of persons
and the maintenance of national security and measures required to
implement international obligations to which Canada has
agreed"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Subsection 24(5) of the NSCA stipulates that a licence that is
issued by the Commission "may contain any term or condition that
the Commission considers necessary for the purposes of this
act."</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sec2">2. Background</h2>
<p>The following International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Safety
Standards documents or updated versions provide general guidance
for conducting high-quality PSAs:</p>
<ul>
<li>IAEA Safety Standard SSG-3, <em>Development and Application of
Level 1 Probabilistic Safety Assessment for Nuclear Power
Plants</em></li>
<li>IAEA Safety Standard SSG-4, <em>Development and Application of
Level 2 Probabilistic Safety Assessment for Nuclear Power
Plants</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sec3">3. Objectives of the Probabilistic Safety
Assessment</h2>
<p>The objectives of the probabilistic safety assessment (PSA)
are:</p>
<ul class="list-lower-alpha">
<li>to provide a systematic analysis, to give confidence that the
design will align with the fundamental safety objectives; the
fundamental safety objective, as established in IAEA N-SF-1, is to
protect people and the environment from harmful effects of ionizing
radiation</li>
<li>to demonstrate that a balanced design has been achieved; this
can be demonstrated as achieved if no particular feature or
postulated initiating event makes a disproportionately large or
significantly uncertain contribution to the overall risk, and the
first two levels of defence in depth bear the burden of ensuring
nuclear safety; reference IAEA INSAG 10 for defence in depth</li>
<li>to provide confidence that small changes of conditions that may
lead to a catastrophic increase in the severity of consequences
(cliff-edge effects) will be prevented</li>
<li>to provide assessments of the probabilities of occurrence for
severe core damage states, and assessments of the risks of major
radioactive releases to the environment; severe core damage, for
CANDU reactors, is defined as a condition where there is extensive
physical damage to multiple fuel channels, leading to loss-of-core
structural integrity; risks of major radioactive releases would
include small and large release frequencies as defined in RD-337
(or proposed successor document) or as established in licensing
basis for the facility</li>
<li>to provide site-specific assessments of the probabilities of
occurrence, and the consequences of external hazards</li>
<li>to identify plant vulnerabilities and systems for which design
improvements or modifications to operational procedures could
reduce the probabilities of severe accidents, or mitigate their
consequences</li>
<li>to assess the adequacy of emergency operating procedures; PSA
insights should be used as part of the system for maintaining the
emergency operating procedures, as these procedures are subject to
improvements throughout an NPP's lifetime</li>
<li>to provide insights into the severe accident management
program; level 2 PSA can support severe accident management
programs; i.e., the development, implementation, training and
optimization of accident management strategies and measures</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sec4">4. Requirements for a Probabilistic Safety
Assessment</h2>
<p>The licensee shall carry out the following activities:</p>
<h3 id="sec4-1">4.1 Probabilistic safety assessment levels</h3>
<p>Perform a level 1 and level 2 PSA for each NPP.</p>
<p>Considerations shall include the reactor core and other
radioactive sources such as the spent fuel pool (also called
irradiated fuel bay). Multi-unit impacts, if applicable, shall be
included.</p>
<p>For radioactive sources outside the reactor core, the licensee
may, with the agreement of persons authorized by the Commission,
choose an alternate analysis method to conduct the assessment.</p>
<h3 id="sec4-2">4.2 Management systems or quality assurance</h3>
<p>Conduct the PSA under the management system or quality assurance
program established in the licensing basis.</p>
<h4>Guidance</h4>
<p>The CSA N286 management system requirements standard and CSA
N286.7, <em>Quality Assurance of Analytical, Scientific and Design
Computer Programs for Nuclear Power Plants</em>, are referenced in
the licensing basis of operating nuclear power plants. The PSA
should be developed in a manner that is consistent with the
management system.</p>
<h3 id="sec4-3">4.3 Probabilistic safety assessment models that
reflect the plant</h3>
<p>The PSA models shall reflect the plant as built and operated
(including multi-unit impacts), as closely as reasonably achievable
within the limitations of PSA technology, and consistent with the
risk impact.</p>
<h3 id="sec4-4">4.4 Update of probabilistic safety assessment
models</h3>
<p>Update the PSA models every five years. The models shall be
updated sooner if the facility undergoes major changes.</p>
<h4>Guidance</h4>
<p>Update the PSA models so that they adequately represent the
as-operated plant conditions.</p>
<h3 id="sec4-5">4.5 Realistic assumptions and data</h3>
<p>Ensure the PSA models are developed using assumptions and data
that are realistic and practical and, where required, supported by
deterministic safety analysis or engineering assessments.</p>
<h3 id="sec4-6">4.6 Consistent level of detail</h3>
<p>The level of detail of the PSA shall be consistent with the
facility testing, maintenance and configuration management
programs, and should be consistent with the intended uses of the
PSA.</p>
<h3 id="sec4-7">4.7 Methodology and computer codes</h3>
<p>Seek CNSC acceptance of the methodology and computer codes to be
used for the PSA before using them for the purposes of this
document.</p>
<h4>Guidance</h4>
<p>The methodology should be suitable to support the objectives of
the PSA (set forth in section 3 of this document) and to support
the intended PSA applications.</p>
<p>Acceptance of the methodology prior to actual PSA development
aims to help ensure the methodology can support the PSA's
objectives. For example, the computer codes that support the
analytical methods should be adequate for the purpose and scope of
the analysis.</p>
<p>Note: At the time of publication, the CNSC was reviewing the
methodology for developing multi-unit PSA toevaluate the site
integrated risk. The CNSC will establish the safety goals for
site-wide PSA, which may consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>interactions between the units, due to an initiating event
(single-unit events and common-mode events), or as a result of the
accident progression</li>
<li>aggregation of risk from internal events, internal hazards, and
external hazards during all operating modes for all units at a
site</li>
<li>radioactive sources other than the reactor cores (noting that
alternate analysis methods may be used if accepted by the
CNSC)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sec4-8">4.8 Site-specific initiating events and potential
hazards</h3>
<p>Include all potential site-specific initiating events and
potential hazards, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>internal initiating events and internal hazards</li>
<li>external hazards, both natural and human-induced, but
non-malevolent</li>
</ul>
<p>Include potential combinations of the external hazards.</p>
<p>The screening criteria of hazards shall be acceptable to the
CNSC.</p>
<p>The licensee may, with the agreement of "persons authorized" by
the Commission, choose an alternate analysis method to conduct the
assessment of internal hazards and external hazards.</p>
<h4>Guidance</h4>
<p>Examples of external hazards are seismic hazards, external fires
(e.g. fires affecting the site and originating from nearby forest
fires), external floods, high winds, off-site transportation
accidents, releases of toxic substances from off-site storage
facilities, severe weather conditions.</p>
<p>Examples of internal hazards are internal fires, internal
floods, turbine missiles, onsite transportation accidents, and
releases of toxic substances from onsite storage facilities.</p>
<h3 id="sec4-9">4.9 Operational states</h3>
<p>Include at-power and shutdown states. A PSA shall also be
performed for other states where the reactor is expected to operate
for extended periods of time and that are not covered by the
at-power and shutdown PSAs.</p>
<h3 id="sec4-10">4.10 Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses</h3>
<p>Include sensitivity analysis, uncertainty analysis and
importance measures in the PSA.</p>
<h2 id="sec5">5. Guidance on Public Disclosure</h2>
<p>In accordance with licensees' public information programs
established under RD/GD-99.3, <em>Public Information and
Disclosure</em>, a summary of the results and assumptions of PSA
should be made available to interested stakeholders. It should be
noted that any information pertaining to the specific fault
sequences and vulnerabilities of a facility include
security-sensitive information and is subject to applicable
information security provisions.</p>
<p>The public information should include high-level summaries for
PSA, including those for methodologies and screening criteria
(subject to necessary security considerations).</p>

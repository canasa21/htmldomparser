<h2><a name="P125_3800" id="P125_3800"></a>1.0 Purpose</h2>
<p>This document provides guidance regarding the process for
granting, denying, renewing or revoking a site access security
clearfixance (SASC) for authorized unescorted entry to a protected
area. The purpose of a SASC is to prevent unreasonable risk to
high-security sites. This includes risks to operations, personnel,
safety and national security from the insider threat.</p>
<h2><a name="P127_4178" id="P127_4178"></a>2.0 Scope</h2>
<p>This document sets out a comprehensive approach and process for
granting, denying or revoking a SASC.</p>
<h2><a name="P129_4287" id="P129_4287"></a>3.0 Relevant
Legislation</h2>

<h2><a name="P155_8387" id="P155_8387"></a>4.0 Process for
Granting, Denying or Revoking a Site Access Security Clearance</h2>
<h3><a name="P156_8465" id="P156_8465"></a>4.1 Site access security
clearfixance assessment</h3>
<p>Licensees should have processes in place, as part of their SASC
measures, to assess the levels of risk presented by applicants and
renewals. Furthermore, the SASC measures should clearfixly set out
established threshold criteria to trigger these processes.</p>
<p>The SASC assessment process consists of two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>an assessment of reliability, which is normally conducted by
the licensee</li>
<li>a security assessment of loyalty and reliability as it relates
thereto, which is conducted by the Canadian Security Intelligence
Service (CSIS) with input from the licensee</li>
</ul>
<p>When assessing reliability, a licensee should verify a person's
character, honesty, background, qualifications and trustworthiness.
The purpose of the SASC assessment is to determine if a person may
access prescribed information or assets without posing an
unreasonable risk to the protected area, to the personnel working
there or to national security. Individuals who have been granted a
security clearfixance equivalent to a Level II, Secret Clearance,
may be required to have access to designated and/or classified
information on a need-to-know basis. The CSIS security assessment
may include a subject interview conducted by CSIS to collect
further information in order to make a determination on loyalty
and/or reliability as it relates to loyalty.</p>
<p>The SASC process is comparable to the Government of Canada (GOC)
security screening process. For more information and a comparison
of the processes, see table 1 in appendix D.</p>
<p>The licensee's SASC measures will be assessed as part of the
CNSC compliance program, in order to determine if it is
satisfactory or not.</p>
<h3><a name="P168_10136" id="P168_10136"></a>4.2 Application
process</h3>
<p>The process for application should include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the licensee obtaining written consent from the applicant to
conduct the necessary investigations (licensee &amp; CSIS)</li>
<li>the applicant providing the necessary information to apply for
the appropriate level of clearfixance (SASC or Level II
equivalent)</li>
<li>the licensee conducting a briefing to the applicant on his/her
responsibilities and certifying the clearfixance.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="P173_10579" id="P173_10579"></a>4.3 Collection and
verification of information</h3>
<p>Before granting a SASC, the licensee should carry out the
following activities:</p>
<p>process the SASC application in order to determine an
applicant's five-year traceable history, by collecting and
assessing the following information:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>personal data, including history of residence, for the five
years immediately preceding the SASC application or, if the
applicant is under 21 years of age, to age 16</li>
<li>criminal records name check (CRNC) in accordance with Canadian
Police Information Centre policy</li>
<li>educational/professional qualifications</li>
<li>employment history</li>
<li>CSIS security assessment</li>
</ol>
<p>perform the requisite checks identified in the <em>Policy on
Government Security (PGS) - Personnel Security Standard Appendix
C,</em> or an equivalent policy or standard<br />
verify all required information, either personally or via a trusted
third party<br />
endorse the reliability of the applicant upon requesting a security
assessment from CSIS<br />
process and verify the completeness of information for a security
assessment before sending it to CSIS; verification of necessary
information for reliability assessments takes place in parallel
with the loyalty assessment that CSIS carries out in support of a
SASC application or renewal.</p>
<h3><a name="P186_11851" id="P186_11851"></a>4.4 Missing or adverse
information</h3>
<p>In cases of gaps in documentation (boxes not checked, initials
missing), the licensee should inform the applicant about it and
ensure the information is complete. If there are gaps in history
(residence or employment), the licensee should contact the
applicant to retrieve all necessary information and, if deemed
necessary, meet with the applicant to clarify any concerns.</p>
<p>In a case of an indictable conviction, the licensee should
conduct a security interview with the applicant. The criteria used
to decide whether a security interview is necessary should include
assessing the risk to site and national security. Failure by the
applicant to declare all criminal convictions will delay the SASC
process and may result in the denial of reliability screening.</p>
<h3><a name="P190_12644" id="P190_12644"></a>4.5 Licensee
decision</h3>
<p>The decision to grant, deny or revoke a SASC rests with the
licensee. The decision should be supported by a licensee policy
that includes a risk-based decision-making process and should also
take into consideration any potential or unreasonable risks to
national security.</p>
<h2><a name="P192_12937" id="P192_12937"></a>5.0 Application
Process for a Site Access Security Clearance</h2>
<h3><a name="P193_12997" id="P193_12997"></a>5.1 Consent and
authorization</h3>
<p>The SASC application should begin with the licensee obtaining
the appropriate authorization to conduct personnel screening of an
applicant. The applicant must give the licensee written
authorization to conduct such screening. This authorization can be
granted by using the Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) Personnel
Screening Consent and Authorization Form (TBS/SCT&nbsp;330-23E:
Rev. 2006/02), where all data is collected in sections A to C and
signed off in sections D and E. See appendix A for the Web links to
the TBS form, and appendix B for the application process map.</p>
<p>Before permitting the applicant to start completing the
Personnel Screening Consent and Authorization Form, the licensee
should advise the applicant that failure to include all required
information, or to complete the form in an accurate or legible
manner, will result in documentation being returned, thereby
delaying the screening process. The licensee should also explain to
the applicant the consequences of attempting to conceal any
information that could affect the degree of confidence that the
licensee could place in him or her.</p>
<p>The licensee completes section A of the form and the applicant
completes sections B and C. For section C, the applicant must
initial the required boxes and sign the bottom of this section. The
licensee must complete the appropriate boxes. The licensee then
completes sections D and E to confirm review and approval.</p>
<p>A credit check may be required, depending on the applicant's
position, access to financial information and funds, or signing
authority. A credit check may also be conducted for cause, which
includes personal bankruptcy or a related criminal conviction
record, such as fraud.</p>
<h3><a name="P201_14726" id="P201_14726"></a>5.2 Screening
process</h3>
<p>Once the licensee has obtained consent to screen the applicant,
and the screening process has been approved, the applicant should
provide all pertinent information to apply for a SASC. This can be
done by using the TBS Security Clearance Form (TBS/SCT 330-60E),
where all compulsory data is collected as determined by the
licensee. See appendix A for a list of web links to the TBS forms,
and appendix B for the application process map.</p>
<p>In addition, the applicant should provide notarized/certified
translations for all supporting documentation (e.g., educational
certificate, CRNC, professional qualifications) that is not in
English or French.</p>
<h4><a name="P205_15392" id="P205_15392"></a>5.2.1 Personal
data</h4>
<p>The licensee should verify the applicant's full name, date and
place of birth. The place of birth should include the city or town
name, province (state) and country.</p>
<p>Verified original documentation should include two pieces of
validly issued government identification from the following
list:</p>
<ul>
<li>birth certificate</li>
<li>passport</li>
<li>valid work permit</li>
<li>permanent resident card</li>
<li>Canadian citizenship card or other government-issued photo
identification</li>
</ul>
<p>At least one piece of photo identification should contain a
current facial view of the applicant.</p>
<h4><a name="P215_15963" id="P215_15963"></a>5.2.2 Less than five
years of traceable history in Canada</h4>
<p>The licensee should have a verification process for SASC
applicants who have less than five years of traceable history
within Canada.</p>
<p>An applicant who has resided or worked in a country outside of
Canada for a period of more than six months within the last five
years should provide a CRNC for each country of previous residence
where the individual was 16 years of age or older. An applicant who
resided in a country where only local checks (e.g., immediate area
where the applicant resided) are completed should have a CRNC (or
equivalent) completed for each area where the person resided. The
applicant should also have a CRNC completed by the country's state
government policing authorities.</p>
<p>Where there are no reciprocal arrangements between different
policing authorities, the applicant should obtain a CRNC from each
authority. For example, for an applicant residing in the United
States, a CRNC and fingerprint check should be conducted at the
county, state and federal levels by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation's National Crime Information Center.</p>
<p>Where CRNC information is unavailable or incomplete, or an
indictable conviction exists, fingerprints should be verified
through a police service agency (in the area of jurisdiction where
the person has resided) or by a trusted third party. There are
several countries that do not have a CRNC process in place. In such
cases, the onus is on the licensee to verify criminal conviction
information from a trusted third party.</p>
<h4><a name="P220_17508" id="P220_17508"></a>5.2.3 Foreign
nationals</h4>
<p>A foreign national should provide identification (e.g., work
visa or passport) and proof of legal status in Canada to the
licensee. A foreign national should also provide, via a trusted
third party, a CRNC from the person's country of origin. A CRNC
should be provided for each country where a foreign national has
resided for a period of six months or more during the past five
years, including all areas and all police authorities within the
country where the person resided.</p>
<p>A SASC should be granted to the individual according to the
licensee's security protocols, risk management processes and the
licensee's SASC measures. Enquiries can only be conducted in
countries that have bilateral/reciprocal agreements with Canadian
investigative authorities.</p>
<h4><a name="P223_18293" id="P223_18293"></a>5.2.4 Employment and
education records</h4>
<p>The licensee, or a trusted third party on behalf of the
licensee, should verify the applicant's education and/or
professional qualifications (e.g., licence, degree or diploma) and
record them by way of a certified copy. The licensee should initial
and date the copy and retain it on file for audit purposes. The
licensee may use an internal form or record that is signed or
certified by the licensee representative to indicate that all
records verified are valid.</p>
<h4><a name="P225_18796" id="P225_18796"></a>5.2.5 Criminal
activity assessment</h4>
<p>Where a CRNC check conducted by the licensee, or a trusted third
party on behalf of the licensee, is incomplete, fingerprints should
be taken for verification and a security interview should be
performed to collect more information.</p>
<p>When an applicant has an indictable conviction, the licensee
should review the criminal history and assess the risk to personnel
safety and/or security to the nuclear facility based on this
information. The risk assessment should include an assessment of
criminal convictions and any information provided by police
agencies that may affect the reliability of a SASC applicant or
renewal, such as links to organized crime. It should also consider
the nuclear facility's operations, including what facility areas or
nuclear material to which the individual may have access. A
criminal conviction, including a self-declaration by the applicant,
that identifies adverse information, will also require a security
interview or an alternate process that suitably assesses risk.</p>
<p>The licensee should have, as part of its SASC measures, a
process to assess risk for personnel with a criminal conviction
record who are being transferred to an assignment or position that
requires access to sensitive information, assets or vital areas.
The transfer of an individual within a high-security site should
trigger a process to assess risk.</p>
<h4><a name="P229_20186" id="P229_20186"></a>5.2.6 CSIS notice of
assessment</h4>
<p>CSIS will provide the licensee with a notice of assessment
(NOA), indicating that adverse information exists from the security
assessment or that there is no adverse information (NOA - NO ADV
INFO) concerning the applicant who requires a SASC. The SASC is
valid for five years from the date of notification from CSIS, with
the provision that CSIS may review the SASC for cause at any
time.</p>
<p>There are three types of notices from CSIS: 1) NRT - NO
REPORtable trACES; 2) NRT - INSUFFICIENT INFO; and 3) NOA - BRIEF.
For the first two notices, the licensee may continue the
application process, following a risk-based decision making
process. For the third notice, the licensee must hold the file and
await more detailed information from CSIS investigators, who will
send a formal letter to the licensee and a copy to the CNSC.</p>
<h3><a name="P232_21048" id="P232_21048"></a>5.3 Security
interview</h3>
<h4><a name="P233_21070" id="P233_21070"></a>5.3.1 Adverse
information</h4>
<p>If an application results in the discovery of adverse
information, a security interview may be required. If the
declaration of a criminal conviction contains circumstances related
to adverse information, the licensee should conduct a security
interview to adequately assess any potential risk to the site
(protected area), including its operation and personnel, and to
identify any threat that may have national security
implications.</p>
<h4><a name="P235_21529" id="P235_21529"></a>5.3.2 Threat and risk
assessment</h4>
<p>One of the purposes of a security interview is for the licensee
to assess risk. An interview should be conducted based on adverse
information, as well as for cause. For example, if an applicant had
been convicted of fraud, and the licensee discovered that the
person had provided false information in regard to professional
qualifications, a security interview should be conducted to assess
risk. Security interviews with the potential for elevated risk
should be conducted by two interviewers. (See appendix C to read
the risk-based decision-making process.)</p>
<p>A SASC may be reviewed at any time for cause. The licensee's
SASC measures should have established threshold criteria that will
"trigger" a security interview or an alternate process that
suitably assesses risk. This could include the circumstances of the
criminal offence (nature, frequency, passage of time, indictable
vs. summary, etc.). Licensees must also consider potential risk to
the site or national security, given the duties and tasks to be
assigned to the individual being considered for the granting of a
SASC.</p>
<p>To determine if the applicant poses a potential threat or risk
to the site, the licensee should conduct a security interview or
have measures in place to suitably address the following
situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>the resolution of incomplete or questionable documentation</li>
<li>poor or questionable credit history</li>
<li>indictable convictions</li>
<li>past criminal activity</li>
<li>less than five consecutive years of traceable history</li>
<li>adverse or insufficient information from CSIS</li>
<li>any other adverse information that has potential risk to site
or national security</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="P247_23193" id="P247_23193"></a>5.3.3
Documentation</h4>
<p>The applicant should bring all required documentation to the
security interview. This material should include original or
verified copies of all documentation related to the SASC,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>proof of legal status (citizenship, marital, etc.)</li>
<li>notarized or certified translation (if not in English or
French) of all CRNCs</li>
<li>passport or visa</li>
<li>educational certificates, diplomas or degrees</li>
</ul>
<p>The licensee's security interview may require a detailed
analytical examination of information provided by the applicant, or
lack thereof, to verify reliability/authenticity where other means
of verification are not available. The security interview may also
include other verification tools, in order to establish the
applicant's reliability.</p>
<h4><a name="P254_23957" id="P254_23957"></a>5.3.4 Interviewer
qualifications</h4>
<p>A licensee's security interview should be conducted by an
experienced interviewer with the requisite training and skills, who
may be a member of the licensee's SASC process. The licensee
determines the qualifications of the interviewer.</p>
<p>Licensees should utilize interviewers trained in forensic
interviewing techniques to conduct interviews related to the
assessment of a SASC applicant or renewal, or for cause. A forensic
interviewing techniques course should include essential subjects
such as detecting deception, conducting a structured interview and
analyzing statements. For further guidance on suitable courses,
licensees may contact the CNSC's Nuclear Security Division.</p>
<h4><a name="P257_24675" id="P257_24675"></a>5.3.5
Record-keeping</h4>
<p>The licensee should have documented processes in place for
conducting security interviews and evaluating interview results.
The documentation and the associated information should be suitably
protected and kept on file.</p>
<h4><a name="P259_24914" id="P259_24914"></a>5.3.6 Decision to
grant, deny, renew or revoke</h4>
<p>The licensee should identify a senior program authority who
decides to grant, deny, renew or revoke a SASC based on the results
of the licensee's risk-based decision-making process, including
reliability/loyalty checks and, if conducted, the security
interview.</p>
<h3><a name="P261_25224" id="P261_25224"></a>5.4 Granting of a site
access security clearfixance</h3>
<p>The licensee may grant a SASC with or without certain
limitations and restrictions to access prescribed information or
assets.</p>
<h4><a name="P263_25399" id="P263_25399"></a>5.4.1 Determinative
assessment - security interview</h4>
<p>If a security interview is deemed necessary and determines the
applicant does not pose a security risk, the licensee may grant a
SASC without restrictions as long as the CSIS assessment has not
identified any adverse information. The licensee may impose
security restrictions with cause (e.g., limitations on hours of
work or access to certain areas of the licensed facility and
nuclear material) while a SASC is in the process of being updated
over an extended period of time. Restrictions should be imposed
only if the licensee has not identified adverse information that
could indicate an unreasonable risk to the health and safety of
persons, or to site and national security.</p>
<h4><a name="P265_26133" id="P265_26133"></a>5.4.2 Restrictions to
control access</h4>
<p>Restrictions may be imposed based on the licensee's own
governance for risk tolerance / acceptance. The licensee should
take into consideration the sensitivity and vulnerability of
certain critical areas, vital areas and inner areas. When granting
a SASC, the licensee has the authority, under subsection 17(5) of
the <em>Nuclear Security Regulations</em>, to implement any terms
and conditions necessary to minimize the risk to the security of
the protected area.</p>
<p>An applicant may, based on a risk assessment, obtain limited
unescorted site access that is subject to certain restrictions
(e.g., limited hours of work; a standalone computer not connected
to the facility network and with no Internet connection; or no
access to prescribed information, prescribed equipment, nuclear
material or nuclear material accounting, or to classified
information or assets). Restrictions should be recorded, clearfixly
communicated, and subject to a documented review process conducted
by the licensee.</p>
<h4><a name="P268_27150" id="P268_27150"></a>5.4.3 Alternative
work</h4>
<p>If the licensee becomes aware that a SASC holder has been
charged with a serious criminal offence or the licensee is made
aware of significant adverse information, the SASC holder should be
assigned alternative work duties until the charge is adjudicated in
court or the information is assessed by the licensee. The applicant
should be placed under appropriate administrative controls and
access control measures, as well as be monitored through the
Supervisory Awareness Program at the licensed site.</p>
<h4><a name="P270_27673" id="P270_27673"></a>5.4.4 Denial of a site
access security clearfixance</h4>
<p>An applicant should not be granted a SASC if, after the security
interview or other checks, a risk assessment determines that:</p>
<ul>
<li>SASC requirements are not met</li>
<li>an unreasonable risk is posed to the site, including its
operation and personnel</li>
<li>a threat or an unacceptable risk is posed that may have a
negative impact on site and national security</li>
</ul>
<p>No applicant should be granted a SASC if the person refuses to
be interviewed or if the licensee or CSIS identifies adverse
information that is considered a security threat or risk to the
facility.</p>
<h3><a name="P276_28270" id="P276_28270"></a>5.5 Revocation of a
site access security clearfixance</h3>
<p>No person should retain his or her SASC - or be processed for a
SASC - if he or she refuses to be interviewed, or if the licensee
identifies adverse information that is considered a security threat
or risk to the facility. If a current SASC holder refuses to be
interviewed, the SASC should be revoked.</p>
<h3><a name="P278_28622" id="P278_28622"></a>5.6 Certification</h3>
<p>Once the decision has been made to grant a SASC, the licensee
should provide a comprehensive briefing (preferably in person but
may be done remotely) to the applicant explaining the individual's
future security responsibilities and obtain acknowledgement from
the person in writing. This can be done by using the TBS Security
Screening Certificate and Briefing Form (TBS/SCT&nbsp;330-47),
where all data is collected in sections A and B, acknowledgement is
declared in section C, and sign-off is completed in section D. See
appendix A for a list of Web links to the TBS forms, and appendix B
for the application process map.</p>
<p>A SASC constitutes the authority for a licensee to allow access
to prescribed information or assets. A SASC alone does not confer a
right of access to classified information assets or sites and does
not give a successful SASC applicant (SASC holder) access to
classified information or assets, including those from a third
party. The applicant must seek a security clearfixance (Level I and
above) for access to classified information or assets. Individuals
who have been granted a security clearfixance equivalent to a Level
II Secret Clearance may have access to designated and/or classified
information on a need-to-know basis. Access to
designated/classified information may only be granted by the author
of the designate/classified document.</p>
<p>The TBS <em>Policy on Government Security</em> governs the
Personnel Screening Standard to ensure that only persons whose
reliability, trustworthiness and loyalty to Canada have been
established are granted access to classified information, assets or
sites. It is important to note that no individual is entitled, by
virtue of rank or position, to have access to, knowledge of, or
custody of classified information and assets. The individual must
have the appropriate Personnel Security Clearance level and an
identified "need to know". (Access includes the opportunity to gain
knowledge of information by visual or auditory means.)
Private-sector organizations do not have the authority to grant any
level of GOC security clearfixance without CNSC sponsorship, which
provides for the necessary arrangements with CSIS and the RCMP (See
table 1 in appendix D).</p>
<h2><a name="P283_30852" id="P283_30852"></a>6.0 Reporting to the
Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission</h2>
<h3><a name="P284_30906" id="P284_30906"></a>6.1 Site access
security clearfixance granted</h3>
<p>SASCs should be granted to applicants who have met all the
requirements of the application process. However, the licensee may
decide to grant a SASC with or without restrictions despite the
following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>the applicant has not met the basic SASC requirements, and the
licensee is unable to resolve gaps subsequent to a security
interview</li>
<li>CSIS provides the licensee with a notice of assessment
indicating there is insufficient information (NRT-INSUF)</li>
<li>CSIS or a police agency identifies adverse information that may
indicate a security risk.</li>
</ul>
<p>In such cases, the licensee should inform the CNSC and provide
justification for its decision.</p>
<p>If a SASC holder's circumstances change and these may pose a
risk to operations, personnel, safety and national security, the
licensee should investigate. Where necessary, the SASC holder
should forward a complete report of the change of circumstances
through the holder's manager to the licensee, who should forward it
on to the CNSC as required. The licensee may deny this individual
access to prescribed information and assets, until the situation is
resolved.</p>
<p>Measures taken by the licensee to mitigate security concerns and
risk acceptance, as identified by circumstances defined in sections
5.2.5 and 5.4.1 of this document, may be subject to CNSC review, to
ensure they are in accordance with paragraph 9(a) (ii) of the
NSCAand paragraph 12(1) (c) of the GNSCR.</p>
<h3><a name="P295_32374" id="P295_32374"></a>6.2 Site access
security clearfixance denied or revoked</h3>
<p>Where a SASC is denied or revoked, the licensee should inform
the CNSC and provide detailed information on why the SASC was
denied or revoked, along with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the level of threat or risk that the individual poses to site
or national security</li>
<li>the source of the information that was used in making the
decision (e.g., law enforcement or security agencies)</li>
<li>the results of any related or ongoing investigation</li>
<li>the CSIS security assessment brief</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="P302_32891" id="P302_32891"></a>6.3 Communication
protocols</h3>
<p>The licensee should report to the CNSC as per requirements.
Licensees have regulatory obligations for notifying the CNSC in
writing, concerning several areas related to the security of a
nuclear facility.</p>
<h2><a name="P304_33123" id="P304_33123"></a>7.0 Site Access
Security Clearance Renewal Process</h2>
<p>The licensee should have an auditable SASC renewal process,
which should include checks that ensure enough time is available to
complete and consider all required verifications and other
assessments before the SASC expires. This will ensure that all
relevant assessment information is reviewed and assessed before a
SASC is renewed, and that any adverse information that is
discovered will be available and on record where a SASC is not
renewed for valid reasons.</p>
<h2><a name="P306_33636" id="P306_33636"></a>8.0
Transferability</h2>
<p>A valid SASC may be transferable from one high-security site to
another, provided there is a CNSC-approved SASC process in place at
both sites. To the extent permitted by law, any adverse information
and restrictions on the applicant should be shared between
licensees during the transfer of a SASC. It is the licensee's
prerogative to decide whether to accept the transfer of a valid
SASC holder to its licensed site.</p>
<p>The SASC of an individual may be transferred between licensees,
provided the following criteria have been met:</p>
<ul>
<li>the SASC is valid, with no adverse information</li>
<li>the SASC is not due for updating before the transfer can take
place</li>
<li>as necessary, the individual has self-declared in writing that
there have been no changes in his/her personal history regarding
criminal convictions</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="P312_34459" id="P312_34459"></a>9.0 Record
Retention</h2>
<p>The licensee should maintain a current listing of all persons
who have been granted or denied a SASC or who were subject to the
revocation of their SASCs for tracking, updating and auditing
purposes. Because of their sensitivity, verified copies of all SASC
documentation (dated and signed) containing personal information
should be retained in an organization's security file and
safeguarded appropriately. Verified copies of all SASC
documentation should be subject to the licensee's governance
regarding the protection, retention and destruction of documents.
Designated/classified documents should be protected according to
TBS guidelines on the protection of these documents. Documents
related to security interviews or risk assessments should be made
available on a need-to-know basis to the appropriate CNSC staff
upon request.</p>
<h2><a name="P314_35317" id="P314_35317"></a>10.0 Termination of
Employment</h2>
<p>Licensees should establish a procedure for dealing with the
termination of employment of individuals who possessed a SASC or
the equivalent of a Level II Secret Clearance and are no longer
employed onsite. The procedure should include a formal debriefing
(preferably in person, but may be done remotely), to remind
individuals of their continuing responsibilities relating to the
protection of prescribed (or designated/classified) information to
which they had access in the course of their employment. If the
termination is a result of a SASC review, the licensee must abide
by section&nbsp;6.2 of this guide.</p>
<h2><a name="P316_35953" id="P316_35953"></a>11.0 Appeal
Process</h2>
<p>The licensee should have an appeal process whereby an applicant
who was denied or revoked a SASC can request a review of the
application in order to clarify items of concern or provide new
information. An appeal process should include the capacity to:</p>
<ul>
<li>organize and utilize a body of individuals that would oversee
and conduct the process</li>
<li>implement and respect consistent timelines for the conduct of
the process</li>
<li>allow for the request and verification of information by the
licensee and submission of additional information by the
applicant</li>
<li>make information available to the applicant that describes the
appeal process, including how submitted information is
reviewed</li>
<li>have a process for decision making regarding the appeal
process, including how the applicant is advised of the appeal
process decision and any subsequent actions and implications for
the applicant or former SASC holder</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="P324_36872" id="P324_36872"></a>Appendix&nbsp;A</h2>
<p>The following forms, as amended from time to time, may be used
for a SASC application, and can be downloaded from <a href=

<h2>CNSC Regulatory Document Series</h2>
<p>Facilities and activities within the nuclear sector in Canada
are regulated by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission
(CNSC).&nbsp;In addition to&nbsp;the <em>Nuclear Safety and Control
Act</em> and associated regulations, there may also be requirements
to comply with other&nbsp;regulatory instruments such as regulatory
documents or standards.</p>
<p>Effective April 2013, the CNSC's catalogue of existing and
planned regulatory documents has been organized under three key
categories and twenty-five series, as set out below. Regulatory
documents produced by the CNSC fall under one of the following
series:</p>
<ul>

<!--DOCTYPE html-->
<p>The CNSC’s Cost Recovery Program provides an equitable approach
to funding CNSC activities by charging licensees all costs
associated with regulatory oversight of the nuclear industry. Each
year, the CNSC conducts a detailed analysis of its costs across all
licence categories and use types. This analysis provides the basis
for adjusting both the hourly rate and fee formulas.</p>
<h2>Hourly rate effective April 1, 2021</h2>
<p>The <a href=
"http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2003-212/FullText.html">
<em>Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission Cost Recovery Fees
Regulations</em></a> (Regulations) provide a mechanism for the CNSC
to set the hourly rate in order to recover full costs. The hourly
rate effective April 1, 2021 remains at $270/hour.</p>
<h2>Formula fees effective April 1, 2021</h2>
<p>In addition to the hourly rate, the Regulations set the formulas
used to determine both the annual and one-time initial application
assessment fees related to licences for nuclear substances and
radiation devices, along with licences for Class II nuclear
facilities and prescribed equipment.</p>
<p>The formulas set both base and variable hours that are used to
determine fees for the various licence categories and use types.
For 2021–22, most formulas will remain the same as those applied in
2020–21 with the exception of dosimetry services, for which an
administrative correction was needed. The change to that formula
will result in a slight increase in the number of hours to which
the annual fee applies. Therefore, your fees will not increase from
2020–21 unless you hold a dosimetry licence or there was a change
in the number of locations or devices.</p>

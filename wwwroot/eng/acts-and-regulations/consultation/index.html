<h2 id="R2">Comment on discussion papers</h2>
<p>Discussion papers play an important role in the selection and
development of the CNSC's requirements or guidance. They are used
to solicit early public feedback on CNSC policies or approaches.
The use of discussion papers early in the regulatory process
underlines the CNSC's commitment to a transparent consultation
process. The CNSC analyzes and considers this early feedback when
determining the type and nature of requirements and guidance to
issue. This process is intended to streamline document development
and publishing.</p>

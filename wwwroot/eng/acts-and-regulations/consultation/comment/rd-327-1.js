<h2>Preface</h2>  <p>This regulatory document provides requirements for the prevention of criticality accidents in the handling, storage, processing, and transportation of fissionable materials. This regulatory document clarifies the physical constraints and limits on fissionable materials that licensees must implement in order to ensure nuclear criticality safety during the construction, operation, or decommissioning of the licensed facility.</p>  <p>This document presents CNSC&#8217;s requirements regarding nuclear criticality safety. The associated guidance document GD-327 <em>Guidance for the Nuclear Criticality Safety</em> provides information as to how these requirements may be met. The information in these regulatory documents is currently reflected in certain existing licence conditions. In those cases, licensees are required to comply. Where no licence condition exists, this regulatory document and the associated guidance document provide guidance and best practices that licensees should apply.</p>  <p>In this document, the word &#8220;shall&#8221; denotes physical constraints and limits that must be met. The word &#8220;should&#8221; denotes strongly-recommended best practices, and the word &#8220;may&#8221; denotes recommended best practices.</p>  <p>Key principles and elements used in developing this document and the associated guidance document are consistent with national and international standards. </p>  <p>Nothing contained in this document is to be construed as relieving any licensee from pertinent requirements. It is the licensee&#8217;s responsibility to identify and comply with all applicable regulations and licence conditions.</p>  <p>If any discrepancies exist between this regulatory document and guidance document GD-327 <em>Guidance for Nuclear Criticality Safety</em>, then the information in this regulatory document RD-327 <em>Nuclear Criticality Safety</em> takes precedence.</p>

Supervisors should be made as responsible for nuclear criticality safety as they are for production, development, research, or other functions. Each individual, regardless of position, shall be made aware that nuclear criticality safety in their work area is ultimately their responsibility. This may be accomplished through training and periodic retraining of all operating and support personnel. Nuclear criticality safety does not differ in any intrinsic way from industrial safety, and good managerial practices apply to both.</p>  <p>Management shall provide personnel skilled in the interpretation of data pertinent to nuclear criticality safety, and familiar with operations, to serve as advisors to supervisors. These specialists should be, to the extent practicable, administratively independent of process supervisors.</p>  <p>Management shall establish the criteria to be satisfied by nuclear criticality safety controls. Distinction may be made between shielded and unshielded facilities, and the criteria may be less stringent when adequate shielding and confinement assure the protection of personnel.</p>  <a name="2.1.2.2"></a>

The most effective neutron reflector commonly encountered in handling and in processing fissile material is water of thickness sufficient to yield maximum nuclear reactivity. However, careful consideration shall be given to systems where significant thicknesses of other common structural materials (e.g.,&nbsp;wood, concrete, steel), which may be more effective neutron reflectors than water, may be present. For some situations, the reflection provided by personnel may be important&nbsp;[8].</p>  <a name="2.1.3.6"></a>
<p><em><a name="P263_28366" id="P263_28366"></a>2.1.3.6 Neutron Interaction</em></p>  <p>Consideration shall be given to neutron interaction between units when at least two units containing fissile material are present.

The methods vary widely in basis and form, and each has its place in the broad spectrum of situations encountered in the nuclear criticality safety field. However, the general procedure to be followed in establishing validity is common to all. For an example of validation of a calculational method, refer to GD-327 <em>Guidance for Nuclear Criticality Safety</em>&nbsp;[1], Appendix&nbsp;C.</p>  <a name="2.1.4.1"></a>

Validation of a calculational method by comparing the results with those of another calculational method, for example, is unacceptable.</p>  <a name="2.1.4.2"></a>
<p><em><a name="P270_29779" id="P270_29779"></a>2.1.4.2 Bias Uncertainties</em></p>  <p>The uncertainty in the bias shall contain allowances for uncertainties in the experimental conditions, for lack of accuracy and precision in the calculational method, and for extension of the area (or areas) of applicability. After allowances are made for the accuracy and precision of the method and for the bias and uncertainty, a margin in the k<sub>eff</sub> or other correlating parameter shall be applied that is sufficiently large to ensure that conditions (calculated by the method to be subcritical by this margin) will actually be subcritical. Like the bias and its uncertainty, this margin may vary with composition and other variables.</p>  <a name="2.1.4.3"></a>

For the purposes of this document, fixed neutron absorbers are materials that:</p>  <ol>
<li>Are an integral part of a facility, equipment, or fuel components;</li>
<li>Have neutron absorption properties; and</li>
<li>Are incorporated into designs to assure margins for subcriticality as needed for normal and abnormal conditions.</li>  </ol>  <p>The use of fixed neutron absorbers for criticality control application shall be conducted in accordance with Section&nbsp;2. Verification of the absorbers and their effectiveness to capture neutrons shall be required before the materials are used.

<h2><a name="P489_65061" id="P489_65061"></a>15.0 Nuclear Criticality Safety Based on Limiting and Controlling Moderators</h2>  <p>For many operations, criticality safety is achieved through the limitation of parameters such as geometry, mass, enrichment, and spacing of fissile materials. The amount of fissile material that can be safely handled, stored, or processed at one time can also depend on the credible range of neutron moderation. Optimum moderation, by definition, results in the lowest critical mass of fissile materials, other conditions being unchanged.</p>  <p>Operations within the scope of this section shall be conducted in accordance with Section&nbsp;2. Safety criteria and practices for achieving criticality safety by the limitation and control of moderators in the range from no moderation to optimum moderation for fissile materials shall be documented and followed. </p>  <p>For additional guidance, refer to Section&nbsp;15 of GD-327 <em>Guidance for Nuclear Criticality Safety</em>&nbsp;[1].</p>  <a name="16.0"></a>
<h2><a name="P493_65987" id="P493_65987"></a>16.0 Nuclear Criticality Accident Emergency Planning and Response</h2>  <p>Nuclear criticality safety programs at facilities that use fissionable material are primarily directed at the avoidance of nuclear criticality accidents. However, the possibility of such accidents exists and the consequences can be life-threatening. This possibility mandates advance planning practice in planned emergency responses and verification of readiness.</p>  <p>This section applies to those facilities for which a criticality accident alarm system, as specified in Section&nbsp;3, <em>Criticality Accident Alarm System</em>, is in use. The provisions of this section may be considered in emergency planning for nuclear power plant sites and research reactor facilities. This section does not apply to off-site accidents, or to off-site emergency planning and response.</p>  <p>For additional guidance on minimizing risks to personnel during emergency response to a nuclear criticality accident outside reactors, refer to Section&nbsp;16 of GD-327 <em>Guidance for Nuclear Criticality Safety</em>&nbsp;[1].</p>

Conversely, whereas most nuclides with an odd number of neutrons are fissile, <sup>237</sup>U (which is an odd number of neutrons nuclide with a very small thermal fission cross section) cannot be made critical with thermal neutrons.</p>  <p><strong>Fissionable</strong></p>  <p>Capable of undergoing fission.</p>  <p><strong>Fixed neutron absorber</strong></p>  <p>Neutron absorbers in solids with an established geometric relationship to the locations occupied by fissionable material.</p>  <p><strong>Fuel unit</strong></p>  <p>The fundamental item to be handled, stored, or transported.

<h3><a name="P58_5735" id="P58_5735"></a>4.0 Licensing Process for Nuclear Substance Laboratories and Nuclear Medicine Rooms</h3>  <p>To obtain a licence for the use of an unsealed nuclear substance, applicants must submit a completed licence application in accordance with section&nbsp;3 of the <em><a name="P59_5976" id="P59_5976"></a>Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices Regulations</em>. As part of the licence application, applicants must submit the proposed design of the room in which unsealed nuclear substances will be used.</p>  <p>The Design Assessment Form (DAF) provided in Appendix&nbsp;C of this document assists licence applicants with the submission of the proposed design of their nuclear medicine room or nuclear substance laboratory. A DAF should be completed for any new construction or major renovation (such as demolishing walls or installing new fumehoods; for additional information, contact a CNSC licensing specialist) and enclosed with the new application or a request for amendment. A good laboratory design facilitates the application of safe policies and procedures.</p>  <p>The completed DAF should be submitted to the CNSC as early as possible in the design stage in order to facilitate the processing of the licence application or amendment. If multiple rooms are to be constructed or renovated and are to be of similar design and function, only one DAF needs to be submitted. Laboratories having different designations (i.e., low, intermediate, high, or containment) or varying design features should each have a separate DAF. CNSC staff may request additional information after the initial design or renovation assessment is complete.</p>

<h4><a name="P110_11568" id="P110_11568"></a>5.2 Supplementary Information for Part F of the Design Assessment Form</h4>
<p>As per subparagraph&nbsp;4(<em>a</em>)(<em>iii</em>) of the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em>, the concept of ALARA must be considered when designing any facility where nuclear substances will be used. With nuclear medicine, this is especially important given that the source, once administered in a person, will not be in a fixed location. At the planning and design stage, the impact of design decisions on potential doses to persons (excluding the patient) should be a prime consideration. CNSC regulatory document G-129 rev&nbsp;1, <em>Keeping Radiation Exposures and Doses &ldquo;As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA)&rdquo;</em>, provides doses below which the CNSC may consider that an ALARA assessment is not required beyond the initial analysis.</p>
<p>As indicated in box&nbsp;F1 of the DAF, assessments of applications with respect to any nuclear medicine room, any high or containment level laboratory, or any area or enclosure associated with veterinary nuclear medicine will include the review of dose estimates for persons (excluding the patient) in the areas where the unsealed nuclear substances will be used. The purpose of this section is to provide guidance on how to determine and demonstrate that radiation dose estimates are ALARA prior to operations.</p>
<a name="5.2.1"></a>
<h5><a name="P113_12858" id="P113_12858"></a>5.2.1 Dose Estimates for Nuclear Medicine Room Design Applications</h5>  <p>Dose estimates will only give a reasonable representation of potential exposures if the parameters are examined carefully to ensure they properly characterize the design and operation of the facility. The applicant or licensee should consider the following parameters when calculating the dose estimates resulting from its intended operations:</p>  <ol>
<li> Layout and construction;</li>
<li> Locations at which these nuclear substances and activities will be used;</li>
<li> Distances between the nuclear substance or patient and the occupied locations of other persons;</li>
<li> Occupancy of the other rooms in the nuclear medicine department and surrounding areas by persons other than the patient (if the facility has more than one floor, consider occupancy above and below);</li>
<li> Nuclear substances and activities (Bq) to be used for the nuclear medicine procedures performed; and</li>
<li> Maximum number of patients per procedure to be treated, annually.</li>  </ol>  <p><a name="P121_13839" id="P121_13839"></a><strong>5.2.1.1 Dose Estimates for Conventional Diagnostic Nuclear Medicine&mdash;A Five-Step Method</strong></p>  <p>The following 5-step method for calculating dose estimates is a suggested approach only; it does not restrict the applicant from using other approaches. Each of these five steps is described in greater detail in Appendix&nbsp;B using an example to illustrate the overall method.</p>  <p><strong>Step 1)</strong> Obtain architectural drawings or make an accurate, scaled and dimensioned sketch of the facility and surrounding areas.</p>  <p>The drawings need to show the locations where significant quantities of nuclear substance will be present, and those occupied locations where persons other than the patient might be expected to be exposed to radiation as a result of the nuclear medicine procedures.</p>  <p><strong>Step 2)</strong> Identify the key locations where nuclear substances are to be used and the number of procedures, as well as the typical activity per procedure, for each of these locations.</p>  <p>The key locations include both the rooms where any nuclear substance will be administered to the patient and the main post-administration locations occupied by patients, such as injection rooms, designated waiting areas, gamma camera rooms, and treadmill rooms. For each location and type of procedure performed:</p>  <ol>
<li> Determine the nuclear substance and typical activity (MBq) to be used for each procedure; and</li>
<li> Estimate the approximate number of procedures to be performed per year.</li>  </ol>  <p><strong>Step 3)</strong> Identify the purpose, type of occupancy and occupancy factor of those areas within, or in the immediate vicinity of, the nuclear medicine department, that will be occupied while nuclear substances are in use.</p>  <p>For each area in which persons (other than the patient) would be expected to receive a radiation dose as a consequence of nuclear medicine activities, determine:</p>  <ol>
<li> What the area is used for (e.g., reception desk, waiting room, gamma camera room, washroom, etc.);</li>
<li> The persons who are normally present in the area, including:
<ol type="a">
<li> Staff who are nuclear energy workers (NEWs), such as nuclear medicine technologists;</li>
<li> Staff who are non-NEWs and are occupationally exposed; and</li>
<li> Non-NEWs who are members of the general public and are non-occupationally exposed, such as persons accompanying patients.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li> The occupancy factor (T) for each location and exposed group (i.e., the fraction of total time during which a radiation field may be present at a particular location, for which another individual may be present at that location). For additional information, refer to the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) Report No.&nbsp;151: <em>Structural Shielding Design and Evaluation for Megavoltage X- and Gamma-Ray Radiotherapy Facilities</em>.</li>  </ol>  <p>When evaluating T, an important consideration is whether or not a person may be at the location of interest <em>while there is a radiation field present in that area</em>.</p>  <p><strong>Step 4)</strong> Estimate the radiation dose rates produced in each potentially occupied area.</p>  <p>Two basic methods are used to estimate the radiation dose rates to which a person (excluding the patient) will be exposed as a result of typical nuclear medicine operations.</p>  <p>The first method is to take direct measurements of the dose rates in surrounding areas, using a sufficiently sensitive, properly calibrated radiation survey meter or other, equivalent method. The type, model, energy range, and energy response of the dose rate meter to be used should be provided. This method is generally useful when evaluating an existing department, or when making a comparative analysis for designing a new room or department that is very similar in layout and design to an existing site. It is particularly useful when an applicant needs to analyze the impact of proposed changes, such as increased workload or changes to the facility layout.</p>  <p>The second method is a mathematical approach that relies, for example, on the known physical properties of the nuclear substances being used, the distances to each occupied area and the shielding properties and thickness of the building materials. This method is generally useful when designing a new room or department. This technique is described in detail in the example provided as Appendix&nbsp;B of this guide.</p>  <p><strong>Step 5)</strong> Extrapolate the measured or calculated dose rates at each location to annual doses for the persons who may occupy each area, based on the projected facility workload and the occupancy factor.</p>  <p>Patients typically occupy several different locations over the course of the nuclear medicine procedure and may contribute to the dose received by a person occupying a single location (e.g., the dose from patients in the injection room, scanner rooms, and post-injection waiting areas may all contribute to the dose received by the receptionist at the front desk). Exposed persons may also occupy several different areas over the course of any given day, some of which may contribute far more significantly to the total radiation dose they incur. Methods of calculating annual doses from measured or calculated dose rates are also described in detail in Appendix&nbsp;B of this guide.</p>  <p><strong>5.2.1.2 Dose Estimates for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Applications</strong></p>  <p>The basic approach to Positron Emission Tomography (PET) shielding design is similar to that for conventional diagnostic nuclear medicine described in section&nbsp;5.2.1.1. The significant difference is in the details; for example, the thickness of shielding required, due to the higher energy 511&nbsp;keV annihilation gammas that are produced.</p>  <p>In such cases, the use of lead may be impractical because of weight and structural considerations. Concrete, either in the form of poured slabs or solid concrete block, is generally a more viable solution to PET shielding problems. The choice of shielding materials is ultimately left to the licensee. The heavy shielding requirements for PET make it difficult to retrofit an existing room to accommodate a PET scanner.</p>  <p>The <em>Medical Physics </em>periodical (33,&nbsp;1; January 2006) provides useful technical information and guidance on shielding requirements and dose estimates specifically related to PET operations&nbsp;[reference&nbsp;21 in <em>Associated Documents</em>].</p>  <p><strong>5.2.1.3 Dose Estimates for In-Patient <sup>131</sup>I Therapy Applications</strong></p>  <p>There is very little difference between conventional diagnostic nuclear medicine dose estimates and those for in-patient nuclear medicine treatments, such as <sup>131</sup>I thyroid cancer treatment. However, the patient is typically isolated in a dedicated treatment room on one of the wards.</p>  <p>The basic approach to <sup>131</sup>I in-patient therapy room shielding calculations is similar to that for conventional diagnostic nuclear medicine described in section&nbsp;5.2.1.1. The significant difference is that, as a condition of the licence, the design must be such that the dose rate in occupied areas around the treated patient&rsquo;s room does not exceed 2.5&nbsp;&micro;Sv/hour or that other patients do not receive a dose in excess of 500&nbsp;&micro;Sv per hospital stay.</p>
<a name="5.2.2"></a>
<h4><a name="P151_20753" id="P151_20753"></a>5.2.2 Dose Estimates for High and Containment Level Laboratories</h4>  <p>For high and containment level laboratories, doses should also be considered at the planning stage. In this case, localized shielding is typically used to ensure dose rates in the surrounding areas are acceptable. The main sources of radiation and the shielding materials should be considered, and resulting dose rates should be provided (by measurement or by calculation). Occupancy of persons in adjacent or nearby areas should be considered and resulting annual doses determined. The intended use of procedural and work practice controls should also be considered and explained.</p>  <p>If specific dose estimates are required, CNSC staff may request additional information upon submission of the application.</p>
<a name="5.2.3"></a>
<h4><a name="P154_21520" id="P154_21520"></a>5.2.3 Dose Estimates for Nuclear Substance Laboratories in Veterinary Nuclear Medicine</h4>
<p>Dose estimates for veterinary nuclear medicine are very similar to dose estimates for conventional diagnostic nuclear medicine. Therefore, the approach to veterinary nuclear medicine shielding calculations is the same as that for conventional diagnostic nuclear medicine (see subsection&nbsp;5.2.1.1).</p>

<h4><a name="P607_33667" id="P607_33667"></a>B.1 Sample Calculation for Dose Estimates for Nuclear Medicine Rooms</h4>  <p>Using the method outlined in subsection&nbsp;5.2.1.1, the following approach can be used to estimate the doses to persons (other than the patient) in and around a nuclear medicine room.</p>  <p><strong>Step&nbsp;1)</strong> Facility Layout</p>  <p>Figure&nbsp;B1 shows a hypothetical nuclear medicine department layout. Dimensions and basic shielding details are shown. Key locations where nuclear substances and nuclear medicine patients will be present for significant periods of time over the course of the workday are identified using letters A to&nbsp;D<sub>2</sub>.</p>  <p><strong>Step&nbsp;2)</strong> Estimating Workload</p>  <p>For any given nuclear medicine facility, several different gamma emitting nuclear substances can be identified that are used regularly (e.g., <sup>51</sup>Cr, <sup>67</sup>Ga, <sup>99m</sup>Tc, <sup>111</sup>In, <sup>123</sup>I, <sup>131</sup>I and <sup>201</sup>Tl). It is unlikely that all of the nuclear substances will be used or will contribute significantly to the annual dose at a particular location. Rather, it is likely that only one or two nuclear substances and procedures will be of importance.</p>  <p><strong><em>Example:</em></strong></p>  <p>Assume that the nuclear medicine department shown in Figure&nbsp;1 primarily performs three types of outpatient diagnostic procedures: cardiac analysis, diagnostic bone scans and thyroid uptake analysis. The typical daily workload and details of the nuclear substances and activities used are presented in Table&nbsp;B1. The annual number of procedures performed is estimated from the daily workload by assuming five days of operation per week (procedures are not done on the weekends), 50 weeks per year.</p>  <p className=""><strong><em><a href="/eng/lawsregs/comment/rd-52/x_fig_b1">Figure&nbsp;B1: Hypothetical Nuclear Medicine Department Layout</a><br />  </em></strong>(View Figure) </p>  <p className=""><strong><em>Table B1: Main Procedures Performed, Nuclear Substances and Activities Used</em> </strong></p>  <table >

However, all types of procedures, total number of patients and average activities should be provided to the CNSC and those used in the assessment should be justified.</p>  <p><strong>Step&nbsp;3)</strong> Occupancy Review</p>  <p>To begin, it must be determined who is exposed to radiation as a consequence of the operation of the nuclear medicine department. For compliance with the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em>, these persons may be considered as either NEWs or non-NEWs.</p>  <p>According to the NSCA, a NEW is a person who is required, in the course of the person&rsquo;s business or occupation in connection with a nuclear substance or nuclear facility, to perform duties in such circumstances that there is a reasonable probability that the person may receive a dose of radiation that is greater than the prescribed limit for the general public, which is 1&nbsp;mSv. For example, nuclear medicine technologists are usually designated as NEWs.</p>  <p>Any person not designated as a NEW is a non-NEW. These may be staff members or members of the general public, and as such are subject to an annual effective dose limit of 1&nbsp;mSv.</p>  <p>Assessing the doses received by every individual from every possible source is impractical, so the evaluation may be simplified by evaluating the proximity, frequency, and duration of exposure for persons in each group to establish the most exposed persons. Only these &ldquo;worst case&rdquo; exposures within each group should be evaluated, as all other persons within each group can be safely assumed to receive lesser doses. </p>  <p>The final stage of the occupancy review determines:</p>  <ol>
<li> Where the nuclear substances and nuclear medicine patients are present (see Figure&nbsp;B1, locations A, B, C, D<sub>1</sub>, and D<sub>2</sub>) and for how long; and</li>
<li> Where the most exposed individuals (other than the patient undergoing the nuclear medicine procedure) are present and for how long.</li>  </ol>  <p>For each location in and around the facility where a significant contribution to the total dose received by a person would be expected, the dose to each representative person, assuming an appropriate occupancy factor, should be determined. The presence of NEWs, non-NEWs, or both, at these locations should be specified. If an individual occupies several of these locations, the dose from all locations should be totalled (this scenario should be considered when assigning occupancy factors).</p>  <p>If occupancy factors are not known, NCRP&nbsp;151 provides guidance on occupancy factors.</p>  <p><strong><em>Example:</em></strong></p>  <p>For the purposes of this example, assume the following:</p>  <ol>
<li> There is one full time receptionist for the nuclear medicine department who spends most of their time in the reception office. The same is true for the adjacent outpatient clinic.</li>
<li> Other ancillary staff, such as cleaning and maintenance staff, are present only infrequently, with restricted access to areas in which nuclear substances are used and with minimal direct exposure to injected patients or radiopharmaceuticals.</li>
<li> Members of the general public who accompany the patients undergoing nuclear medicine procedures do so a maximum of a few times per year.</li>
<li> Physicians working in the adjacent outpatient clinic spend approximately one half of their time in the examining rooms immediately adjacent to the camera suites and stress testing room.</li>
<li> The clinic is a single story building, built on grade, so there is no occupancy below and very minimal occupancy above (e.g., during roof repairs).</li>  </ol>  <p>For this example, we assume that persons (other than the patient) will occupy the following locations: the corridor, the office, the camera room(s), the exam rooms in the neighbouring clinic, and the reception area. These key locations cover areas of occupancy of technicians (NEWs) and non-NEWs, including the physician in the adjoining clinic. Other locations may also need to be considered&mdash;the locations used in this example are for illustrative purposes. The complete example in this guide is worked out only for the reception area/receptionist. The same approach would be used for the other locations or other representative individuals.</p>  <p>The key parameters needed to estimate the total annual doses are listed in Table&nbsp;B2.</p>  <p className=""><strong><em><a href="/eng/lawsregs/comment/rd-52/x_tbl_b2">Table B2: Occupancy Summary</a></em> </strong><br />  (View Table) </p>  <p><strong>Step&nbsp;4)</strong> Dose Rate Calculations</p>  <p>The following approach assumes the source/patient can be approximated as a point source. For most distances, the point source is a sufficiently accurate representation. In addition, at distances greater than 1&nbsp;meter, assuming point source geometry is conservative compared to other viable geometrics such as a volumetric source. The choice of source geometry is left to the discretion of the applicant, but the method for estimation must be clearly indicated.</p>  <p>A general formula for performing dose rate calculations for a point source is:</p>  <p>Equation {1}<img className="image-actual" src="/eng/acts-and-regulations/consultation/comment/rd-52/images/e-4.gif" alt="rd-52" width="140" height="51" /> </p>  <p>Where:</p>  <p> </p>  <table className="table table-striped">

When performing dose rate calculations, care must be taken to ensure the consistency of units between <em>R<sub>ij</sub></em>, &Gamma;<em><sub>i</sub></em> and <em>A<sub>i</sub></em>. Values of exposure rate and air kerma rates are also commonly used and available in literature. These values should be converted to values of dose rate.</p>  <p>Tenth value layer (TVL) thicknesses for common gamma-emitting nuclear substances and various shielding materials are available from a number of different sources<sup><a href="#P743_43296" name="P743_43297" id="P743_43297">3</a></sup>. Diagnostic nuclear medicine rooms are typically shielded using commercially available lead sheeting, with normal thicknesses varying from 0.8&nbsp;mm (1/32&nbsp;inch) to 3.2&nbsp;mm (1/8&nbsp;inch). For poly-energetic sources, the &ldquo;first&rdquo; broad beam TVL thickness may be much smaller than subsequent TVLs due to the selective absorption of low energy photons via photoelectric interactions. This effect is commonly referred to as &ldquo;radiation hardening&rdquo; or &ldquo;beam hardening&rdquo;. For this reason, care must be taken when evaluating transmission through barriers greater than 1&nbsp;TVL thick for nuclear substances such as <sup>67</sup>Ga, <sup>111</sup>In, <sup>123</sup>I,<sup> 131</sup>I, or <sup>201</sup>Tl.</p>  <p><strong><em>Example:</em></strong></p>  <p>Table B3 summarizes the parameters required to perform the dose rate estimates for the receptionist.

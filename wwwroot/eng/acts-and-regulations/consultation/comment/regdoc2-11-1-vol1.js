<h2 id="sec3">3. Background</h2>  <p>Radioactive waste in Canada is defined as any material (liquid, gaseous, or solid) that contains a radioactive nuclear substance, as defined in section 2 of the NSCA, for which no further use is foreseen. In addition to containing nuclear substances, radioactive waste may also contain hazardous substances, that are not radioactive, as defined in section 1 of the <em>General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations</em>.</p>  <p>All nuclear substances associated with licensed activities will eventually become radioactive waste. Therefore, the safe management of that waste is considered during all steps of its management. The steps involved in the management of radioactive waste can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>generation and control</li>
<li>handling, which may comprise
<ul>
<li>collecting</li>
<li>sorting</li>
<li>segregating</li>
<li>packaging</li>
<li>loading</li>
<li>transferring</li>

<div id="6.1"></div>
<h3 id="sec6-1">6.1 Waste classification</h3>  <p>The licensee shall implement a radioactive waste classification system. The classification system shall be based on the specific safety case and safety assessment required for the waste management facility or activity.</p>   <p>Waste should be classified according to the degree of containment and isolation required to ensure safety with consideration given to the hazard potential of different types of waste and the timeframe associated with the hazard.</p>   <p>In Canada, there are four main classes of radioactive waste recognized:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Low-level radioactive waste (LLW) contains material with radionuclide content above established clearance levels and exemption quantities (set out in the <em>Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices Regulations</em>), but generally has limited amounts of long-lived activity. LLW requires isolation and containment for periods of up to a few hundred years. An engineered near surface disposal facility is typically appropriate for LLW.</p>
<p>LLW includes the following sub-classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very-low-level radioactive waste (VLLW) has a low hazard potential and is above the criteria for clearance and exemption levels. Long-term waste management facilities for VLLW do not need a high degree of containment or isolation. Concentrations of longer lived radionuclides in VLLW are generally very limited. A near surface repository is generally suitable for the disposal of VLLW.</li>
<li>Very-short-lived low-level radioactive waste (VSLLW) is waste that can be stored for a decay period of not more than a few years and subsequently cleared for release. VSLLW includes radioactive waste containing only short half-life radionuclides typically used for research and biomedical purposes. The main criterion for VSLLW is the half-life of the predominant nuclides. In general, the management of VSLLW should only be applied to radionuclides with a half-life of 100 days or less.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Intermediate-level radioactive waste (ILW) generally contains long-lived radionuclides in concentrations that require isolation and containment for periods greater than several hundred years. ILW needs no provision, or only limited provision, for heat dissipation during its storage and disposal. Due to its long-lived radionuclides, ILW generally requires a higher level of containment and isolation than can be provided in near surface repositories. Waste in this class may require disposal at greater intermediate depths of the order of tens of metres to a few hundred metres or more.</li>
<li>High-level radioactive waste (HLW) is used nuclear fuel that has been declared as radioactive waste and/or is waste that generates significant heat via radioactive decay.  HLW typically has levels of activity concentration in the range of 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> TBq/m<sup>3</sup>. HLW is associated with penetrating radiation thus shielding is required. HLW also contains significant quantities of long-lived radionuclides necessitating long-term isolation. Placement in deep, stable geological formations at depths of several hundred metres or more below the surface is recommended for the long-term management of HLW.</li>
<li>Uranium mine and mill tailings are a specific type of radioactive waste generated during the mining and milling of uranium ore and the production of uranium concentrate. In addition to tailings, mining activities typically result in the production of large quantities of waste rock as workings are excavated to access the ore body. The wastes contain long-lived activity that does not decrease significantly over extended time periods. In general, long-term management in near-surface facilities adjacent to mines and mills is the only practical option for these wastes, given the large volumes of waste generated in mining and milling operations. Further information can be found in REGDOC-2.11.1, <em>Waste Management Volume II: Management of Uranium Mine Waste Rock and Mill Tailings</em> [8].</li>

<h2>CNSC Regulatory Document Series</h2>
<p>Facilities and activities within the nuclear sector in Canada are regulated by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC). In addition to the <em>Nuclear Safety and Control Act </em>and associated regulations, these facilities and activities may also be required to comply with other&nbsp;regulatory instruments such as regulatory documents or standards.</p>
<p>Effective April 2013, the CNSC&#39;s catalogue of existing and planned regulatory documents has been organized under three key categories and twenty-five series, as set out below. Regulatory documents produced by the CNSC fall under one of the following series:</p>
<ul className="list-bullet-none">
<li><strong>1.0 Regulated facilities and activities</strong></li>
<li>Series 1.1 Reactor facilities
<ul className="list-bullet-none">

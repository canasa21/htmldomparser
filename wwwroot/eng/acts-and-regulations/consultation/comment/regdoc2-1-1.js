<h2 id="sec2">2. Management system information</h2>  <p>The CNSC  expects licensees to adhere to all CSA N286-12 <sup id="fnb1-ref"><a className="fn-lnk" href="#fnb1"><span className="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup> principles as the basis of  their management system and the corresponding core management processes. A  management system implemented in accordance with these principles and  requirements has features to assure safe operations. The requirements for a  management system apply throughout the lifecycle of the licensed activity and  extend to all safety and control areas (SCAs). </p>  <p>For nuclear facilities that do not  have a licence condition for management system, the principles in CSA N286-12  can serve as guidance for establishing an effective management system. Further  guidance on this matter is also found in other industry standards such as CAN/CSA-ISO  9001:16, <em>Quality Management Systems –  Requirements</em> <sup id="fnb2-ref"><a className="fn-lnk" href="#fnb2"><span className="wb-inv">Footnote </span>2</a></sup> and ISO 14001,<em> Environmental management systems</em> <sup id="fnb3-ref"><a className="fn-lnk" href="#fnb3"><span className="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a></sup>. </p>  <h3><strong>CSA N286-12 structure and principles </strong></h3>
<p>CSA N286-12  <sup id="fnb1-ref"><a className="fn-lnk" href="#fnb1"><span className="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup> integrates requirements from other management system standards for quality,  health and safety, environment, economics and security. It therefore provides a  basis upon which a single management system may be implemented. </p>  <p>CSA N286-12 is based on a set of 12  principles described below. The first two principles are aimed at ensuring that  safety is properly considered in all decisions and actions, and that licensees  are expected to design, plan and control their activities in order to meet all  requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>safety is the paramount  consideration guiding decisions and actions</li>
<li>the business is defined, planned  and controlled</li>
</ul>  <p>As captured in the next three  principles, to meet all requirements an organization must ensure that it is  aligned with top management direction and able to establish, communicate and  achieve the objectives and priorities it sets for itself: </p>  <ul>
<li>the organization is defined and  understood</li>
<li>resources are managed</li>
<li>communication is effective</li>  </ul>  <p>The remaining principles ensure that processes are established for  managing activities consistently and for verifying that the desired objectives  are achieved. Adherence to the following remaining principles can ensure that measures  are in place to address deficiencies and to provide for continual improvement:</p>  <ul>
<li>information is managed</li>
<li>work is managed</li>
<li>problems are identified and  resolved</li>
<li>changes are controlled </li>
<li>assessments are performed</li>
<li>experience is sought, shared and  used</li>
<li>the management system is  continually improved</li>  </ul>  <p>CSA N286-12 is organized for ease  of use for applicable facility types mentioned in the standard. The standard  shows the generic requirements applicable to the facility types listed below,  while each section thereafter applies to one or a group of facilities  identified in the title. The table below shows the various facility types and  corresponding sections containing CNSC management system requirements.</p>  <table className="table table-striped">

<h3 id="sec3-1">3.1	Leadership</h3>  <p>The role and behaviour of leaders in an  organization are fundamental to achieving excellence in safety. Through the  development and implementation of an effective management system, the organization can better  understand and promote a healthy safety culture.</p>  <p>CSA N286-12 <sup id="fnb1-ref"><a className="fn-lnk" href="#fnb1"><span className="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup> recognizes leadership in its  scope and through requirements specific to top management. CSA N286-12 applies  to top management, as defined in the standard, with overall accountability for  the nuclear facility. Top management defines, plans and controls the business  (licensed activities) through processes that define expectations for the  organization and the means to monitor performance. Expectations of top  management include making use of effectiveness reviews to continuously assess  and improve its management system, as well as utilizing the latter to understand and promote a healthy  safety culture. </p>  <p>Recently issued management system  standards such as CAN/CSA-ISO 9001:16, <em>Quality Management Systems – Requirements</em>   <sup id="fnb2-ref"><a className="fn-lnk" href="#fnb2"><span className="wb-inv">Footnote </span>2</a></sup>, and the IAEA&rsquo;s  GSR Part 2, <em>Leadership and Management for  Safety: General Safety Requirements</em> <sup id="fnb5-ref"><a className="fn-lnk" href="#fnb5"><span className="wb-inv">Footnote </span>5</a></sup>, have further elaborated on  leadership expectations and requirements in recognition of the key role leaders  have in an organization. These standards include requiring top management to  demonstrate leadership and commitment to the management system by:</p>  <ul>
<li>taking accountability for the  effectiveness of the management system</li>
<li>ensuring the integration of the  management system requirements into the organization&rsquo;s processes</li>
<li>communicating the importance of  effective management and of conforming to the management system requirements</li>
<li>ensuring that the management  system achieves its intended results</li>
<li>engaging, directing and supporting  persons in order to contribute to the effectiveness of the management system</li>
<li>supporting other relevant  management roles to demonstrate their leadership as it applies to their areas  of responsibility </li>
<li>establishing, advocating and  adhering to an organizational approach to safety that stipulates that issues  relating to safety receive the attention warranted by their significance</li>
<li>acknowledging that safety encompasses  interactions between people, technology and the organization </li>
<li>establishing behavioural expectations  and fostering a strong safety culture</li>
<li>establishing the acceptance of  personal accountability in relation to safety on the part of all individuals in  the organization and ensuring that decisions made at all levels take account of  the priorities and accountabilities for safety</li>  </ul>

<h3 id="sec3-2">3.2 Safety Cutlure</h3>  <p>The CNSC fully supports the concept that an organization that actively  fosters a healthy safety culture can have a powerful influence on employee  attitudes and behaviours, and consequently, on individual and corporate safety performance.</p>  <p>The CSA N286-12 <sup id="fnb1-ref"><a className="fn-lnk" href="#fnb1"><span className="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup> safety culture requirement  states  the following: &ldquo;Management  shall use the management system to understand and promote a safety culture … .&rdquo;<sup id="fnb2b-ref"><a className="fn-lnk" href="#fnb2"><span className="wb-inv">Footnote </span>2</a></sup> It is through the management system that organizations understand their prevailing  culture. Top management communicates the vision and objectives of the  organization while upholding the key principle that &ldquo;safety is the paramount  consideration guiding decisions and actions&rdquo;. Safety culture is understood and  improved through key management processes such as assessments and continuous  improvement.</p>
<p>For further information on the CNSC&rsquo;s  approach to safety culture, refer to REGDOC-2.1.2, <em>Safety Culture </em>  <sup id="fnb6a-ref"><a className="fn-lnk" href="#fnb6"><span className="wb-inv">Footnote </span>6</a></sup>, which sets out specific requirements and guidance for assessing and  fostering a healthy safety culture. </p>

Licensees&rsquo; supply chain management processes  implemented in accordance  with CSA N286-12 are sufficiently robust to provide assurance that non-compliant  items and services entering the supply chain are properly identified and  dispositioned. </p>  <p>CSA standard N299, <em>Quality assurance  program requirements for the supply of items and services for nuclear power  plants</em> [7] was specifically developed for use by nuclear power plants for their  suppliers. Therefore, this standard can also be used as guidance for the other  classes of licensees with respect to the implementation of supply chain  management processes and requirements for their suppliers. </p>  <h4 id="sec-3-3-1">3.3.1 Counterfeit, fraudulent and  suspect items</a></h4>  <p>While not  mentioned in any specific section of CSA N286-12 <sup id="fnb1-ref"><a className="fn-lnk" href="#fnb1"><span className="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup>, effectively implemented  supply chain processes and adherence to the requirements of the management  system can mitigate against the introduction of counterfeit, fraudulent and  suspect items (CFSI) into the supply chain of a nuclear facility and/or  activity. CFSI are items that:</p>  <ul>
<li>have been intentionally  misrepresented as having met a code or standard when they have not </li>
<li>have been intentionally misrepresented  as having been certified when they have not </li>
<li>are suspected of either of the  above</li>  </ul>  <p>The global supply chain is often long and complex, and the source of CFSI may be unknown. The risks  presented by CFSI can be reduced by the effective implementation of a  management system in accordance with CSA N286-12. The supply management  processes include:</p>  <ul>
<li>audits of the supplier&rsquo;s  management system to assess processes for the prevention, detection and removal  of foreign material including CFSI</li>
<li>selection of qualified, reputable  and reliable vendors based on their ability to supply an acceptable product or  service with adequate measures for the prevention, detection and removal of  foreign material including CFSI</li>
<li>identification of purchasing  requirements including technical performance requirements;  applicable codes, standards, and  specifications;  and inspection, test,  and acceptance requirements that permit the identification and detection of  CFSI during verification</li>
<li>verification that the item  received was fabricated, tested and inspected prior to shipment, in accordance  with the applicable code, specification, purchase order (including technical  performance requirements) or drawings</li>
<li>provisions  for extending applicable requirements to sub-suppliers for the prevention, detection  and removal of foreign material including CFSI </li>
<li>CFSI experience gained is  identified and collected, reviewed for relevance and significance, incorporated  into supply chain processes and used to initiate improvement</li>  </ul>  <p>It  is important to note that it is not only the supply chain that is affected by  CFSI. Organizational functions such as engineering, maintenance and operations  also need to be cognizant of CFSI issues and able to deal with them. </p>  <p>Additional CFSI  information is available in IAEA TECDOC-1169, <em>Managing </em><em>suspect  and counterfeit  items  in the nuclear  industry</em> <sup id="fnb8a-ref"><a className="fn-lnk" href="#fnb8"><span className="wb-inv">Footnote </span>8</a></sup>.

Managing contractors has taken on a new dimension that requires  special attention to ensure that contractors:</p>  <ul>
<li>work in a safe environment </li>
<li>possess the necessary  qualifications and obtain the necessary training </li>
<li>work in accordance with licensee  requirements </li>
<li>deliver products and services that  meet regulatory requirements </li>  </ul>  <p>Licensees are  accountable for the work performed by contractors.</p>

<h2 id="sec4">4. Radiation safety oversight:  Nuclear substance licensees, radiation device licensees and Class II nuclear facility  licensees</a></h2>  <p>Nuclear  substance licensees, radiation device licensees, and Class II nuclear facility  licensees have the primary responsibility for safety of the licensed  activities. Licensees are expected to demonstrate that they are qualified to  undertake the proposed activities and have made adequate provision for the  health and safety of persons and protection of the environment. This includes  demonstrating that they can manage and control the licensed activities.  Licensees must provide effective management support, including both human and  financial resources, to properly implement and maintain their radiation safety  programs, meeting all of the programs&rsquo; regulatory obligations. This includes  addressing the requirements of section 4 of the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em>.</p>  <p>When  implementing safety and control measures, licensees should take into account the  management system principles outlined in section 2 of this regulatory document,  recognizing that measures should be appropriate to their unique structure and  governance framework. Program oversight should be comprehensive and integrate  the roles and responsibilities of the applicant authority, the radiation safety officer and the radiation safety committees,  as applicable. Oversight activities include assessing the effectiveness of the  safety and control measures, identifying opportunities for improvement and  resolving any problems. </p>  <p>Licensees  may have an existing system of controls and processes that govern their overall  operations. In such cases, radiation safety programs should be integrated  within the licensees&rsquo; existing management system.</p>  <p>The  elements of leadership outlined in section 3.1 of this regulatory document  should be employed by licensees&rsquo; top management. Furthermore, the principles  underpinning a healthy safety culture, as described in section 3.2 of this  document, should be considered by licensees when implementing their safety and  control measures.</p>

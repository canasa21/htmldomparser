<h2 className="reportHeading2">Preface</h2>  <p>This guidance document provides details of the information that nuclear power plant (NPP) licensees are to report to the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) as specified in conditions of applicable operating licences. </p>  <p>This document provides direction and clarification to the mandatory reporting requirements and information important to the public, that requires immediate notification. Information for lower safety significance situations or events is also captured for follow-up reporting, scheduled reporting, management control and necessary actions, audit and program review. Reporting requirements are expected to be fulfilled using best management practices and objective-based and risk-assessment principles, in alignment with RD-99.2 and industry norms.</p>  <p>This guidance document serves as a companion to RD-99.2, <em>Reporting Requirements for Operating Nuclear Power Plants: Compliance Monitoring.</em> RD-99.2 sets out the types of reports and the frequency and the applicable time frame for reporting. Reporting timeframe is determined by the safety significance of the event; for example, high safety significance events are reported immediately to the CNSC.</p>  <p>This document contains guidance, explanatory information, forms, and templates provided by the CNSC to assist users in meeting the requirements of RD-99.2.  The reporting program provided in this suite of documents is intended to enable the CNSC and industry to track, trend, and analyze situations and events, and to develop improvement initiatives.</p>  <p>This document is a part of a suite of regulatory documents providing event and routine compliance monitoring reporting requirements, and the public information and disclosure requirements for nuclear facilities. Each regulatory document is accompanied by a complementary guidance document.</p>  <p>Key principles and elements used in developing this document are consistent with national and international standards. The complete list of standards is included in the <em>Additional Information</em> section and includes CSA-N285.4, <em>Periodic Inspection of CANDU Nuclear Power Plant Components </em>from the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) and the <em>Boiler &amp; Pressure Vessel Code</em> from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).</p>  <p>Nothing contained in this document shall be construed as relieving any licensee from pertinent requirements. It is the licensee&#8217;s responsibility to identify and comply with all applicable regulations and licence conditions.</p>

<h3 className="reportHeading3"><a name="P569_27958" id="P569_27958"></a>A.1 Accident Severity Rate, Accident Frequency Rate</h3>  <p>1.0 Purpose:</p>  <ul>
<li>To indicate the accident severity rate and accident frequency rate at NPPs.</li>
<li>To monitor performance in meeting nuclear industry standards in the area of worker safety. &nbsp; </li>
<li>To compare Canadian NPP performance internationally.</li>  </ul>  <p>2.0 Definition:</p>  <ul>
<li>The accident severity rate (ASR) is the total number of days a person is unavailable for work due to any disabling injuries per 200,000 person hours worked at a NPP. Accident frequency rate (AFR) is the number of disabling injuries per 200,000 person hours worked at a NPP. The value 200,000 person hours is equivalent to 100 person years worked. </li>  </ul>  <p>3.0 Calculation:</p>  <ul>
<p>ASR = Number of days disabled&nbsp; / Number of person hours x 200,000<br />
<br />
AFR = Number of disabling injuries  / Number of person hours x 200,000</p>  </ul>  <p>4.0 Notes:</p>  <ul>
<p>4.1 A disabling injury is one that prevents an employee from reporting for work or from effectively performing all the duties connected with the employee&#8217;s regular work. </p>
<p>4.2 An employee is any individual (contractor, temporary staff) performing work at the NPP.</p>
<p>4.3 The Canadian federal reporting requirement for severity includes non-work days not worked. For example, a person is hurt on the last regularly scheduled shift and then is away for two days that were regularly scheduled off. If the person would not have been able to work those two days, but was able to return to work on the first regularly scheduled day, those two days would be counted as lost days.</p>
<p>4.4 Recurrent injuries are attributed back to the originating accident. For example, if an injury from an accident that resulted in a lost time injury occurred in 2008 and then recurred in 2010, with no new accident, the lost days would not appear in the 2010 totals. These days are attributed back to 2008.</p>
<p>4.5 Permanent (or partial) disability resulting from a disabling injury can be assigned equivalent lost days by the licensee. Submit appropriate information showing conversion data for each disabling injury.</p>

<p>5.1 The Chemistry Index is reported as the percentage of time in specification and is calculated as follows for each parameter: </p>
<p><img src="gd-99-2/images/a.2.5.5.1.png" alt="" width="515" height="67" /></p>  <p>The initiation of an out-of-specification event occurs with the first result measured outside the range of the specification, as indicated in licensee-specific chemistry program documentation. </p>
<p>Termination of the event can only be achieved by reducing the control parameter within the specification range. Calculate the duration of the out-of-specification condition as the time between the first out-of-specification sample and the next measured in-specification sample. The % time in-specification is then calculated as 100% - S (% time of measurement period out-of specification).</p>
<p>The total operating hours in the period refers to the total operating hours for the system that the chemical parameter pertains to.</p>
<p>5.2 Parameters included in the indicator but not measured (because the monitoring capability did not exist or whose measurements were not obtained during the period, e.g., an instrument not available) will be reported as being out-of-specification. In cases where the parameter is out-of-specification due to the unavailability of a facility, the parameter is reported as being out-of-specification.</p>
<p>When the safety of chemical technicians or employees could be adversely affected by new hazards during normal execution of their tasks, or when the status of the plant is such that the chemical measure is useless or unrepresentative, the representative period will be adjusted without penalty. Such measures will be qualified &quot;void&quot;. The data is to be auditable.</p>
<p>In some cases a temporary exemption is granted for measurement of a parameter, or deviation of a specification from the range specified in program documentation. The chemistry program authority grants this exemption. It is acceptable to indicate &#8216;not applicable&#8217; for the parameter for the specific time period. If temporary exemption applies for less than one quarter, calculate the time-in-specification for the parameter as the time that the temporary exemption does not apply. Temporary exemptions are intended to be used when instruments or facilities are not available for a significant period of time, where there are temporary modifications to licensee procedures due to new concerns regarding unsafe conditions, or when short duration trials are being carried out. Records pertaining to the temporary exemption are auditable.</p>
<p>Whenever the parameter is deemed not applicable (N/A), a short explanatory note, as well as a reference to the licensee&#8217;s documentation for any temporary exemption, should accompany the submission on these performance indicators. </p>
<p>In cases where the parameter is deemed N/A for a particular period of time, the number of parameters in the equation in Section 3 should be adjusted to reflect the number of parameters actually tracked during the specific quarter.</p>
<p>5.3 For those systems whose performance is reported only for unit operating conditions, the following guideline is to be utilized: </p>
<p>If a parameter is in (or out of) specification before a shutdown, it is considered to remain in (or out of) specification once the system is back in service until it is re-analyzed and found to be otherwise.</p>
<p>5.4 Report performance for all Chemistry Index and Chemistry Compliance Index parameters using the specifications documented in the most current revision of the licensee&#8217;s Chemical Specifications Manual. Performance must be reported for all time periods when the system is considered to be in an operational state, as defined by licensee-specific documents.</p>
<p>5.5 The reference chemical specifications and sampling frequency for each parameter is as documented in the most current revision of the licensee&#8217;s Chemical Specifications Manual. Note any deviations from these reference values for reporting on these performance indicators in report submissions. Document any changes to the specifications and sampling frequency in the Chemical Specifications Manual and supporting documentation.</p>
<p>The minimum sampling/monitoring frequency is determined by the licensee&#39;s current requirements.</p>
<p>5.6 Each station will determine whether results from grab samples or on-line instrument readings will be used to calculate the performance. On-line instrument readings are the preferred method if an adequate quality management program or management system is in place to ensure accuracy.</p>
<p>Where on-line monitoring equipment is available, the success ratio is calculated as the ratio of time where the monitoring is on-line and valid data is available and within range over total time. When monitoring equipment fails, it is permissible to replace the monitoring with manual sampling techniques at a reasonable frequency.</p>
<p>5.7 For multi-unit sites, the unit performance is the average of the performance of the individual control parameters. On an operating unit basis:</p>   <p><img src="gd-99-2/images/a.2.5.5.7.png" alt="" width="515" height="67" /></p>
<p>5.8 The station result is the time-weighted average of the operating units&#39; Chemistry or Chemistry Compliance index values. This ensures that units that were operating for only part of the period are not given the same weight as those that operated for the whole period. </p>  <p><img src="gd-99-2/images/a.2.5.5.8.png" alt="" width="515" height="67" /></p>
<p>5.9 Performance need not be reported for parameters during short duration trials or tests being conducted to optimize chemistry that affects those parameters.</p>

<li>To compare performance between Canadian NPPs.</li>  </ul>  <p>2.0 Definition:</p>  <p>Preventive maintenance completion ratio is the ratio of preventive maintenance (PM) jobs completed divided by the preventive maintenance plus corrective maintenance (CM) jobs completed.</p>  <p>Preventive maintenance is an action that detects, precludes or mitigates degradation of a functional SSC to sustain or extend its useful life by controlling degradation and failures to an acceptable level. Preventive maintenance may be periodic, planned or predictive.</p>  <p>Corrective maintenance is an action that, by means of repair, overhaul or replacement, restores the capability of a failed SSC to perform its defined function within acceptance criteria.</p>  <p>3.0 Calculation:</p>
<img src="gd-99-2/images/a.10.png" />
<p>4.0 Notes: </p>  <ul>
<p>4.1 Preventive maintenance jobs are jobs performed on the safety-related system equipment in the field that is in working order when the job commences. Preventive maintenance jobs include those that are frequency or condition based.</p>
<p>4.2 Corrective maintenance jobs are performed as a result of a reported failure of safety-related system equipment. The maintenance jobs cannot include design modifications.</p>
<p>4.3 Work orders on safety-related systems are work orders that are written during the quarter to correct deficiencies. Work orders must have undergone a preliminary review by the NPP work management group and be designated as valid to be included in the count for a quarter.</p>
<p>4.4 Report data by unit, including the common unit for multi-unit NPPs. Jobs are counted by work order issued to each discipline, not on a task basis. Count a work order that covers repetitive jobs for multiple equipment as one order for each separate piece of equipment.</p>

<h3 className="reportHeading3"><a name="P917_57558"></a>A.11 Radiation Occurrence Index</h3>  <p>1.0 Purpose:</p>  <ul>
<li>To indicate the number and weighted severity of radiation occurrences that have taken place at the NPP. </li>
<li>To monitor performance in meeting the CNSC&#8217;s expectations in the area of worker radiation protection.</li>  </ul>  <p>2.0 Definition:</p>  <p>A radiation occurrence is an occurrence where one or more of the following has occurred:</p>  <ul>
<li>fixed body contamination exceeding 50 kBq/square metre (1.35 Ci/m<sup>2</sup>) has been detected </li>
<li>an unplanned acute whole body dose (resulting from an external exposure) exceeding 5 mSv (500 mrem) has been received </li>
<li> an unplanned acute intake of radioactive material resulting in an effective dose greater than 2&nbsp;mSv (200 mrem) has taken place </li>
<li>an acute or committed dose in excess of any of the limits specified in the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em> Part 1 (Ontario Power Generation), <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em> (Bruce Power), <em>Directives de Sant&amp; et Normes de Radioprotection</em> (Hydro-Quebec), or the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em> (New Brunswick Power) has been received</li>  </ul>  <p>3.0 Calculation:</p>  <p>Radiation occurrence index&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= a + 5b + 5c + 50d</p>  <p>where: </p>  <p>a = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; number of occurrences in a quarter, after decontamination attempts, where fixed body contamination in excess of 50 kBq/square metre (1.35&nbsp;&#956;Ci/m<sup>2</sup>) was measured</p>  <p>b = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number of occurrences in a quarter where an unplanned acute whole body dose (resulting from an external exposure) exceeding 5 mSv (500 mrem) was received</p>  <p>c = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sum of the effective doses, normalized to 2 mSv, for occurrences in a quarter where an intake of radioactive material resulted in an effective dose greater than 2 mSv (200 mrem)</p>  <p>d = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number of occurrences in a quarter where an acute or committed dose in excess of any of the limits specified in the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations </em>Part 1 (Ontario Power Generation), <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em> (Bruce Power), the <em>Directives de Sant&eacute; et Normes de Radioprotection</em> (Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec), or the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em> (New Brunswick Power) was received.</p>  <p>4.0 Notes: </p>  <ul>
<p>4.1 The values of the weighting factors (1, 5, 5, and 50) required to differentiate between the least safety significant radiation occurrences and the most serious ones are not risk-based. They are an approximation of the significance for each type of situation or event. </p>
<p>4.2 The total for &#8216;c&#8217; above is normalized to 2 mSv. This means that the actual dose received as a result of the occurrence(s) is divided by 2 mSv. For example: two unplanned exposures as a result of separate intake incidents, one of 3 mSv and one of 4 mSv, would result in a value for &#8216;c&#8217; =&nbsp; 3 mSv/2 mSv + 4 mSv/2 mSv = 1.5 + 2 = 3.5. This value &#8216;c&#8217; would then be multiplied by the weighting factor 5.</p>
<p>4.3 Only the higher level of consequence will be calculated for a single occurrence to prevent double counting. For example:&nbsp;if a single occurrence results in an unplanned acute whole body dose exceeding 5 mSv (500 mrem), and in the affected worker&#8217;s whole body dose exceeding the legal limit, the occurrence would be counted as a &#8220;d&#8221; type of occurrence (the most serious type) and not as one &#8220;b&#8221; type and one &#8220;d&#8221; type.</p>
<p>4.4 As an example of the calculation of the Radiation Occurrence Index, given the following values:</p>
<p>a = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 occurrences in a quarter, after decontamination attempts, where fixed body contamination in excess of 50 kBq/square metre (1.35 &#956;Ci/m<sup>2</sup>) was measured </p>
<p>b = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 occurrence in a quarter where an unplanned acute whole body dose (resulting from an external exposure) exceeding 5 mSv (500 mrem) was received but did not exceed the plant radiation dose limits specified in their radiation protection regulations</p>
<p>c = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.5 example from 4.2 above for two unplanned exposures of 3 mSv and 4 mSv</p>
<p>d =
1 occurrence in a quarter where an acute or committed dose exceeded any of the limits specified in the plant radiation protection regulations and not also included in the count for &#8220;b&#8221;</p>
<p>Radiation Occurrence Index  = a + 5b + 5c +50d <br />
= 2 +5(1) + 5(3.5) + 50(1) <br />
= 74.5</p>

Supporting Data </h3>  <p>RD-99.2 section 2.2.2.4 h): Provide the data that supports the licensee&#8217;s assessments over the calendar year of the reliability of the systems important to the safety of the NPP. Relevant data shall include:</p>  <ol className="lower-roman">
<li>assumed rates of failure of system components </li>
<li>significant trends in component failure rate data</li>
<li>input data regarding human reliability</li>
<li>list of scheduled activities to inspect, monitor, test or verify the system&#8217;s reliability</li>
<li>data regarding the impairment (failure, incipient failure or degraded ability) of one or more system components as a direct result of a shared or common cause</li>  </ol>  <h4 className="reportHeading4">B.5.1 Component failure data</h4>  <p><em><strong>B.5.1.1 Failure rates</strong></em></p>  <p>This section describes major updates of the component failure rate data and the specific changes in failure rates from the failure rate database experienced over the calendar year. The failure database used for reliability model should be presented in Report Appendix B.3. This section should describe any significant failure rate change or significant trend. The definition of significant failure rate change or significant trend should be clearly described.</p>  <p><em><strong>B.5.1.2 Failure modes</strong></em></p>  <p>This section describes any failure mode that occurred during the calendar year and is not modelled in the system fault trees, as well as its impact on the system reliability.</p>  <h4 className="reportHeading4">B.5.2 Human reliability data</h4>  <p>This section reports human actions that could affect the reliability of the system important to safety. Some human actions that directly affect the reliability of the systems important to safety may be included in section B.3.1.3, but a comparison to the human errors considered in the reliability model should be performed.</p>  <h4 className="reportHeading4">B.5.3 Dependent failures</h4>  <p><em><strong>B.5.3.1 Shared cause </strong></em></p>  <p>This section reports events resulting in inter-system shared dependent impairments that cause unavailability of multiple components belonging to different systems and can be included in the reliability models explicitly. For instance, a failure of an instrument air manifold that supplies air to multiple components in more than one independent system would result in an inter-system shared cause dependent failure and should be reported in this section.</p>  <p>Intra-system dependent impairments having impact on one system only are described in the section of individual system (e.g., if the manifold supplies air to multiple components but in only one system, the failure would be identified as an intra-system shared cause dependent failure and might be described in the section of individual system).</p>  <p><em><strong>B.5.3.2 Common cause </strong></em></p>  <p>This section reports events that may result in inter/intra-system dependent failure or degradation, but reliability model cannot include the failure cause explicitly. Even though section B.3.2 reports human induced common cause failures, this section should identify these events as common cause failures.</p>  <h4 className="reportHeading4">B.5.4 List of scheduled maintenance and surveillance activities</h4>  <p>The list of scheduled activities to inspect, monitor, test or verify the system&#8217;s reliability should be included here or in an appendix.</p>  <h4 className="reportHeading4">B.5.5 Other plant specific data </h4>  <p>This section includes other plant specific data not included in sections B.3.1 and B.3.2. The reliability statistics of special equipment can be included here. </p>

<h2 id="sec1">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) defines
“management system” as “the framework of processes, procedures and
practices used to ensure that an organization can fulfill all tasks
required to achieve its objectives safely and consistently.”
<sup id="fnb1a-foot"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fnb1"><span class=
"wb-inv">Footnote</span> 1</a></sup> Management system requirements
provide overall direction to the licensee organization for
developing and implementing sound management practices and controls
for the organization. An effective and well-implemented management
system helps to assure the CNSC that licensees will conduct their
licensed activities safely.</p>

<h2 id="sec2">2. Management system information</h2>
<p>The CNSC expects licensees to adhere to all CSA N286-12 <sup id=
"fnb1-ref"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fnb1"><span class=
"wb-inv">Footnote</span> 1</a></sup> principles as the basis of
their management system and the corresponding core management
processes. A management system implemented in accordance with these
principles and requirements has features to assure safe operations.
The requirements for a management system apply throughout the
lifecycle of the licensed activity and extend to all safety and
control areas (SCAs).</p>
<p>For nuclear facilities that do not have a licence condition for
management system, the principles in CSA N286-12 can serve as
guidance for establishing an effective management system. Further
guidance on this matter is also found in other industry standards
such as CAN/CSA-ISO 9001:16, <em>Quality Management Systems –
Requirements</em> <sup id="fnb2-ref"><a class="fn-lnk" href=
"#fnb2"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote</span> 2</a></sup> and ISO
14001, <em>Environmental management systems</em> <sup id=
"fnb3-ref"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fnb3"><span class=
"wb-inv">Footnote</span> 3</a></sup>.</p>
<h3><strong>CSA N286-12 structure and principles</strong></h3>
<p>CSA N286-12 <sup id="fnb1-ref"><a class="fn-lnk" href=
"#fnb1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote</span> 1</a></sup> integrates
requirements from other management system standards for quality,
health and safety, environment, economics and security. It
therefore provides a basis upon which a single management system
may be implemented.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CSA N286-12 is based on a set of 12 principles described below.
The first two principles are aimed at ensuring that safety is
properly considered in all decisions and actions, and that
licensees are expected to design, plan and control their activities
in order to meet all requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>safety is the paramount consideration guiding decisions and
actions</li>
<li>the business is defined, planned and controlled</li>
</ul>
<p>As captured in the next three principles, to meet all
requirements an organization must ensure that it is aligned with
top management direction and able to establish, communicate and
achieve the objectives and priorities it sets for itself:</p>
<ul>
<li>the organization is defined and understood</li>
<li>resources are managed</li>
<li>communication is effective</li>
</ul>
<p>The remaining principles ensure that processes are established
for managing activities consistently and for verifying that the
desired objectives are achieved. Adherence to the following
remaining principles can ensure that measures are in place to
address deficiencies and to provide for continual improvement:</p>
<ul>
<li>information is managed</li>
<li>work is managed</li>
<li>problems are identified and resolved</li>
<li>changes are controlled</li>
<li>assessments are performed</li>
<li>experience is sought, shared and used</li>
<li>the management system is continually improved</li>
</ul>
<p>CSA N286-12 is organized for ease of use for applicable facility
types mentioned in the standard. The standard shows the generic
requirements applicable to the facility types listed below, while
each section thereafter applies to one or a group of facilities
identified in the title. The table below shows the various facility
types and corresponding sections containing CNSC management system
requirements.</p>

<h3 id="sec3-1">3.1 Leadership</h3>
<p>The role and behaviour of leaders in an organization are
fundamental to achieving excellence in safety. Through the
development and implementation of an effective management system,
the organization can better understand and promote a healthy safety
culture.</p>
<p>CSA N286-12 <sup id="fnb1-ref"><a class="fn-lnk" href=
"#fnb1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote</span> 1</a></sup> recognizes
leadership in its scope and through requirements specific to top
management. CSA N286-12 applies to top management, as defined in
the standard, with overall accountability for the nuclear facility.
Top management defines, plans and controls the business (licensed
activities) through processes that define expectations for the
organization and the means to monitor performance. Expectations of
top management include making use of effectiveness reviews to
continuously assess and improve its management system, as well as
utilizing the latter to understand and promote a healthy safety
culture.</p>
<p>Recently issued management system standards such as CAN/CSA-ISO
9001:16, <em>Quality Management Systems – Requirements</em>
<sup id="fnb2-ref"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fnb2"><span class=
"wb-inv">Footnote</span> 2</a></sup>, and the IAEA’s GSR Part 2,
<em>Leadership and Management for Safety: General Safety
Requirements</em> <sup id="fnb5-ref"><a class="fn-lnk" href=
"#fnb5"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote</span> 5</a></sup>, have
further elaborated on leadership expectations and requirements in
recognition of the key role leaders have in an organization. These
standards include requiring top management to demonstrate
leadership and commitment to the management system by:</p>
<ul>
<li>taking accountability for the effectiveness of the management
system</li>
<li>ensuring the integration of the management system requirements
into the organization’s processes</li>
<li>communicating the importance of effective management and of
conforming to the management system requirements</li>
<li>ensuring that the management system achieves its intended
results</li>
<li>engaging, directing and supporting persons in order to
contribute to the effectiveness of the management system</li>
<li>supporting other relevant management roles to demonstrate their
leadership as it applies to their areas of responsibility</li>
<li>establishing, advocating and adhering to an organizational
approach to safety that stipulates that issues relating to safety
receive the attention warranted by their significance</li>
<li>acknowledging that safety encompasses interactions between
people, technology and the organization</li>
<li>establishing behavioural expectations and fostering a strong
safety culture</li>
<li>establishing the acceptance of personal accountability in
relation to safety on the part of all individuals in the
organization and ensuring that decisions made at all levels take
account of the priorities and accountabilities for safety</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sec3-2">3.2 Safety Cutlure</h3>
<p>The CNSC fully supports the concept that an organization that
actively fosters a healthy safety culture can have a powerful
influence on employee attitudes and behaviours, and consequently,
on individual and corporate safety performance.</p>
<p>The CSA N286-12 <sup id="fnb1-ref"><a class="fn-lnk" href=
"#fnb1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote</span> 1</a></sup> safety
culture requirement states the following: “Management shall use the
management system to understand and promote a safety culture …
.”<sup id="fnb2b-ref"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fnb2"><span class=
"wb-inv">Footnote</span> 2</a></sup> It is through the management
system that organizations understand their prevailing culture. Top
management communicates the vision and objectives of the
organization while upholding the key principle that “safety is the
paramount consideration guiding decisions and actions”. Safety
culture is understood and improved through key management processes
such as assessments and continuous improvement.</p>
<p>For further information on the CNSC’s approach to safety
culture, refer to REGDOC-2.1.2, <em>Safety Culture</em> <sup id=
"fnb6a-ref"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fnb6"><span class=
"wb-inv">Footnote</span> 6</a></sup>, which sets out specific
requirements and guidance for assessing and fostering a healthy
safety culture.</p>

<h3 id="sec3-3">3.3 Supply Chain</h3>
<p>The specific requirements for a supply chain described in CSA
N286-12 <sup id="fnb1-ref"><a class="fn-lnk" href=
"#fnb1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote</span> 1</a></sup> apply to
the supply of services as well as items. Licensees’ supply chain
management processes implemented in accordance with CSA N286-12 are
sufficiently robust to provide assurance that non-compliant items
and services entering the supply chain are properly identified and
dispositioned.</p>
<p>CSA standard N299, <em>Quality assurance program requirements
for the supply of items and services for nuclear power plants</em>
[7] was specifically developed for use by nuclear power plants for
their suppliers. Therefore, this standard can also be used as
guidance for the other classes of licensees with respect to the
implementation of supply chain management processes and
requirements for their suppliers.</p>
<h4 id="sec-3-3-1">3.3.1 Counterfeit, fraudulent and suspect
items</h4>
<p>While not mentioned in any specific section of CSA N286-12
<sup id="fnb1-ref"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fnb1"><span class=
"wb-inv">Footnote</span> 1</a></sup>, effectively implemented
supply chain processes and adherence to the requirements of the
management system can mitigate against the introduction of
counterfeit, fraudulent and suspect items (CFSI) into the supply
chain of a nuclear facility and/or activity. CFSI are items
that:</p>
<ul>
<li>have been intentionally misrepresented as having met a code or
standard when they have not</li>
<li>have been intentionally misrepresented as having been certified
when they have not</li>
<li>are suspected of either of the above</li>
</ul>
<p>The global supply chain is often long and complex, and the
source of CFSI may be unknown. The risks presented by CFSI can be
reduced by the effective implementation of a management system in
accordance with CSA N286-12. The supply management processes
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>audits of the supplier’s management system to assess processes
for the prevention, detection and removal of foreign material
including CFSI</li>
<li>selection of qualified, reputable and reliable vendors based on
their ability to supply an acceptable product or service with
adequate measures for the prevention, detection and removal of
foreign material including CFSI</li>
<li>identification of purchasing requirements including technical
performance requirements;&nbsp; applicable codes, standards, and
specifications; &nbsp;and inspection, test, and acceptance
requirements that permit the identification and detection of CFSI
during verification</li>
<li>verification that the item received was fabricated, tested and
inspected prior to shipment, in accordance with the applicable
code, specification, purchase order (including technical
performance requirements) or drawings</li>
<li>provisions for extending applicable requirements to
sub-suppliers for the prevention, detection and removal of foreign
material including CFSI</li>
<li>CFSI experience gained is identified and collected, reviewed
for relevance and significance, incorporated into supply chain
processes and used to initiate improvement</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that it is not only the supply chain
that is affected by CFSI. Organizational functions such as
engineering, maintenance and operations also need to be cognizant
of CFSI issues and able to deal with them.</p>
<p>Additional CFSI information is available in IAEA TECDOC-1169,
<em>Managing</em> <em>suspect and counterfeit items in the nuclear
industry</em> <sup id="fnb8a-ref"><a class="fn-lnk" href=

prevention, detection and mitigation of CFSI</p>
<h4 id="sec-3-3-2">3.3.2 Management of contractors</h4>
<p>The nuclear industry has recently increased the practice of
engaging the services of contractors for a wide array of work,
which includes not only the provision of lifecycle activities or
specific one-time jobs, but also the conduct of routine processes
such as maintenance. Managing contractors has taken on a new
dimension that requires special attention to ensure that
contractors:</p>
<ul>
<li>work in a safe environment</li>
<li>possess the necessary qualifications and obtain the necessary
training</li>
<li>work in accordance with licensee requirements</li>
<li>deliver products and services that meet regulatory
requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>Licensees are accountable for the work performed by
contractors.</p>

Class II nuclear facility licensees have the primary responsibility
for safety of the licensed activities. Licensees are expected to
demonstrate that they are qualified to undertake the proposed
activities and have made adequate provision for the health and
safety of persons and protection of the environment. This includes
demonstrating that they can manage and control the licensed
activities. Licensees must provide effective management support,
including both human and financial resources, to properly implement
and maintain their radiation safety programs, meeting all of the
programs’ regulatory obligations. This includes addressing the
requirements of section 4 of the <em>Radiation Protection
Regulations</em>.</p>
<p>When implementing safety and control measures, licensees should
take into account the management system principles outlined in
section 2 of this regulatory document, recognizing that measures
should be appropriate to their unique structure and governance
framework. Program oversight should be comprehensive and integrate
the roles and responsibilities of the applicant authority, the
radiation safety officer and the radiation safety committees, as
applicable. Oversight activities include assessing the
effectiveness of the safety and control measures, identifying
opportunities for improvement and resolving any problems.</p>
<p>Licensees may have an existing system of controls and processes
that govern their overall operations. In such cases, radiation
safety programs should be integrated within the licensees’ existing
management system.</p>
<p>The elements of leadership outlined in section 3.1 of this
regulatory document should be employed by licensees’ top
management. Furthermore, the principles underpinning a healthy
safety culture, as described in section 3.2 of this document,
should be considered by licensees when implementing their safety
and control measures.</p>

<h2>CNSC Regulatory Document Series</h2>
<p>Facilities and activities within the nuclear sector in Canada
are regulated by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC). In
addition to the <em>Nuclear Safety and Control Act</em> and
associated regulations, there may also be requirements to comply
with other&nbsp;regulatory instruments such as regulatory documents
or standards.</p>
<p>Effective April 2013, the CNSC's catalogue of existing and
planned regulatory documents has been organized under three key
categories and twenty-five series, as set out below. Regulatory
documents produced by the CNSC fall under one of the following
series:</p>

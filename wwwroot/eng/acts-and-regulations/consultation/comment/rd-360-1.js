<h2 className="reportHeading2">Preface</h2>  <p>Nuclear power plants in Canada are subject to the ongoing regulatory oversight of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission to ensure their operation does not pose unreasonable risk to health, safety, security or the environment, and conforms to Canada&#8217;s international obligations regarding the peaceful use of nuclear energy. </p>  <p>Regulatory document RD-360 version 2, <em>Life Management of</em> <em>Nuclear Power Plants </em>describes the regulatory requirements for the long-term operation of a nuclear power plant (NPP) and for the end of its operation. The associated guidance document GD-360 <em>Guidance for Life Management of Nuclear Power Plants (draft)</em> [1] provides information as to how these requirements may be met.</p>  <p>Long-term operation of an NPP denotes operation beyond the assumed design life of the plant. The licensee may decide to maintain continued operation of the facility up to its refurbishment or permanent shutdown, or may initiate refurbishment activities to support the period of long-term operation. The licensee must provide assurances that the safety case is maintained for all activities authorized under the power reactor operating licence throughout the period of long-term operation. Specifically, the licensee must demonstrate that the NPP will continue to meet the licensing basis and seek opportunities to improve safety. This is accomplished through the completion of an Integrated Safety Review (ISR) which is a comprehensive evaluation of the design, condition, and operation of the NPP. The licensee addresses the results of the ISR through an integrated implementation plan (IIP). </p>  <p>The licensee may decide to end operation of the NPP. The end of operation is the final, permanent shutdown of an NPP&#8217;s reactor operation (or a unit of a multi-unit NPP facility); the NPP facility remains subject to its power reactor operating licence that authorizes activities during the transition period from reactor unit shutdown and safe state of storage until it enters the decommissioning phase. The licensee must then implement an end of operation plan, including a sustainable operations plan for the safe operation of the NPP until the final permanent shutdown of each reactor. Depending upon the strategy chosen, the end of operation plan must also include either a detailed decommissioning plan or a safe state of storage plan for the transition period until decommissioning the NPP.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Other health, safety and environmental considerations may dictate adherence to additional requirements. It is the responsibility of the licensee to identify any other applicable legislation or standards.</p>

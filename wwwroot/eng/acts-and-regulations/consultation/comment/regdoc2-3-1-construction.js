<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This regulatory document is part of the CNSC&rsquo;s Operating Performance series of regulatory documents, which also covers commissioning of reactor facilities and accident management. The full list of regulatory document series is included at the end of this document and can also be found on the CNSC&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/acts-and-regulations/regulatory-documents/index">nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/acts-and-regulations/regulatory-documents</a></p>
<p><em>Construction of Reactor Facilities</em> is a companion piece to <em>Commissioning of Reactor Facilities</em>, which is also under development. Before publication, these two documents will be put together as discrete parts of a larger document entitled REGDOC-2.3.1, <em>Operating Performance: Conduct of Licensed Activities</em>.</p>
<p><em>Construction of Reactor Facilities</em> sets out the CNSC&rsquo;s requirements for the construction of reactor facilities. This regulatory document identifies and explains safety-significant construction activities to be considered, checked and reviewed in order to ensure the quality and safety of a new or modified reactor facility.</p>
<p>This document provides a framework within which the requirements and guidance in other regulatory documents, codes and standards can be applied to construction management and activities. By implementing this framework, the licensee can ensure the physical construction of the plant is effectively managed and consistent with design requirements.</p>
<p>Reactor facilities will likely be constructed by contractors and sub-contractors with the licensee undertaking primarily an oversight role. Nonetheless the licensee has the primary responsibility for safety, and must ensure directly, or indirectly, that adequate provisions have been made for the safety of the public, workers and the environment for all construction activities. Effective oversight of construction activities is essential to maintain the construction safety case and to support the operations safety case.</p>

<h3 id="sec6-3">6.3 	Emergency preparedness</h3>
<p>Measures shall be established to prepare for, respond to and recover from an emergency. For sites at existing nuclear facilities, emergency preparedness shall consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>the average and peak employment at the site throughout the construction or modification project</li>
<li>training of construction site personnel</li>
<li>provision of alarms to alert all onsite personnel, taking specific construction activities into account</li>
<li>the risks associated with construction activities</li>
<li>evacuation times and response times of any emergency vehicles or response capability</li>
</ol>
<p>For construction sites at existing nuclear facilities, the licensee shall perform a risk and threat assessment to identify any increased risks to the site. Preventive measures shall be taken to manage risks to the existing facility, by construction activities such as dredging, quarrying and blasting, and the creation of connections between the site and the facility.</p>
<p>Sites without an existing nuclear facility nearby shall be able to support their emergency response needs independently. If an existing nuclear facility is in close proximity, mutual aid agreements may be put in place to support emergency response. As construction proceeds the licensee shall ensure that emergency measures in place are commensurate with onsite hazards.</p>
<p>Onsite emergency response units shall be qualified and fully complemented (personnel and equipment) to ensure an expedient and effective response. These response units shall be able to deliver fire and first aid response, spill recovery and hazardous material response, and search and rescue response in case of structure collapse or cave-in.</p>

<h3 id="sec6-4">6.4 	Effect on and from existing facilities</h3>
<p>A construction site may already have onsite operating facilities; these may have interdependent safety or support systems. Other critical facilities, such spent fuel pools or dry cask storage, may also be present. Research reactor sites may already have associated laboratories, isotope production facilities and hot cells.</p>
<p>An assessment of safety and security during construction shall be performed. It shall consider all hazards from, or to, nearby site facilities and any interdependence of their safety systems. The consequences of potential contamination (nuclear and hazardous substances) from a construction site to operating units, as well as from operating site to construction site, shall be assessed and its contamination monitored if necessary. All other potential risks shall also be assessed (for example, excavation, accidental fall of cranes, collapse of items, use of explosives, etc.). Such consideration shall also include an impact assessment of cumulative environmental discharges for all facilities on a site.</p>
<p>The responsibilities of the relevant licensee(s) and the construction organization for safety and security shall be agreed upon before the start of construction activities at the site. Close communication and cooperation between the parties shall be established. All steps shall be taken to ensure that the existing facility can be operated safely and securely during construction activities.</p>
<p>For adjacent installations or those with common buildings or services, the following boundaries shall be identified: controlled areas; physical; system; security access boundaries; and clean zones. When using the resources of existing nuclear installations (such as water, electric power, fire protection, emergency medical services, and security), clear interfaces shall be defined so as not to jeopardize operating installations. Emergency plans shall take full account of the presence of other parties in the area. Procedures shall be implemented to ensure the licensee of an existing facility or facilities endorses a change of status for those common buildings or services before the construction organization puts such plans in place.</p>

<h3 id="sec10">10. 	Configuration Control</h3>
<p>During manufacturing, onsite construction and testing, inevitable design changes shall be managed to ensure that consistency of design, as well as the physical facility being built, is maintained. Change control processes shall ensure that approved changes are accurately reflected in design requirements, facility configuration information, and the physical configuration. Such changes include:</p>
<ol>
<li>design changes</li>
<li>field changes</li>
<li>non-conformances</li>
<li>changes to as-built condition</li>
<li>changes to as-built test documentation</li>
<li>changes inaugural inspection records</li>
<li>computer software changes</li>
<li>changes to records of maintenance history</li>
<li>temporary modifications and alterations</li>
</ol>
<p>The CNSC shall be notified where configuration changes have an impact on the submitted design and licensing basis information.</p>
<h4>Guidance</h4>
<p>Design changes that could have an impact on safety should be minimized after construction starts and should be recorded according to a well-defined process, so that the safety of the as-built design is achievable.</p>

<p>The control of construction records shall be established and shall be consistent with the schedule for accomplishing construction activities. Construction records shall furnish documentary evidence that SSCs meet specified requirements forming part of the facility configuration information. Construction records shall be identified, generated, authenticated, and maintained, and their final disposition specified as required by regulation, law, code, standard, specification, procedure or contract. </p>
<p>Photographic and, where appropriate, video records and computer simulations shall be compiled, particularly in areas that will eventually be inaccessible or will be subject to intense radiation. This information will facilitate the planning of work in these areas during commissioning, operation and decommissioning. These visual construction records of as-built conditions shall show identification marks and shall be catalogued with descriptive captions. This will ensure that visual records made during subsequent inspections or maintenance work can be easily compared, and will help in any work preparation.</p>

<h2 className="reportHeading2">Preface</h2>  <p>In order to obtain a licence to construct for a nuclear power plant in Canada, a formal application must be submitted to the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC). </p>  <p>This document applies to applications for a licence to construct a water-cooled nuclear power plant. This document does not presuppose or limit an applicant&#8217;s intention to follow any particular kind of water-cooled reactor technology.</p>  <p>This document follows the format of the IAEA Safety Guide No. GS-G-4.1, <em>Format and Content of the Safety Analysis Report for Nuclear Power Plants</em> [<a href="#R1">1</a>], but it is more specific to the Canadian context. In following these guidelines, applicants can submit the appropriate information to demonstrate that they are qualified, and will make adequate and reasonable provisions to undertake the activity to be licensed, pursuant to subsection 24(4) of the <em>
Nuclear Safety and Control Act</em> and associated regulations.</p>  <p>The CNSC will review the submitted application and judge if the information contained in the application is acceptable. If the CNSC accepts this information, it becomes the reference safety case for the plant, and will form part of the licensing basis at the construction licence stage. The information provided with the licence application, including the documents to which the application makes reference, constitutes the construction safety case.</p>  <p>The information that will be required at the time of the operating licence application will be added to this construction safety case, and the two applications together will constitute the facility reference safety case. The reference safety case is then kept up to date over the facility&#8217;s lifetime to reflect its current state and condition.</p>

Confirmation should be provided that the personnel responsible for compliance have direct access to senior levels of the applicant&#8217;s management structure, to ensure that their needs and concerns receive adequate consideration. Finally, this section should describe measures taken to ensure the implementation and observance of the safety management procedures.</p>  <p>This section should describe the management system (MS). The description should demonstrate that appropriate provisions integrating safety, health, environmental, security, quality and economic elements have been implemented for all safety-related plant activities. These activities should include design (including engineering assessment and analysis), procurement of goods and services (including the use of contractors&#8217; organizations), manufacturing, plant construction, commissioning, operation, and decommissioning.</p>  <p>The described MS arrangements should demonstrate that the applicable quality management or management system standards (e.g., CSA Standard N286-05, <em>Management system requirements for nuclear power plants</em> [<a href="#R2">2</a>]), have been and will continue to be met.</p>  <a name="3.3"></a>
<h3 className="reportHeading3"><a name="P324_20470"></a>3.3 Consideration of safety culture</h3>  <p>Safety culture is applicable to all the activities that can have an impact on health, safety and on the environment, and it applies to all personnel involved in every phase of the plant&#8217;s lifecycle. This section should describe the strategy leading to the establishment and maintenance of a healthy safety culture for all parties (including contractors and sub-contractors) involved in design, procurement, construction, commissioning, operation, and decommissioning activities that can impact safety throughout the life of the plant. The description of the programs that have been and will be established and promoted should contain detailed information, to a degree sufficient to demonstrate the manner in which safety culture has been/will be developed, documented, promoted, maintained, continuously assessed, and enhanced.</p>  <a name="3.4"></a>
<h3 className="reportHeading3"><a name="P326_21334"></a>3.4 Design authority</h3>  <p>This section should demonstrate that the expectations set out in section 5.1 of RD-337 will be met.</p>  <p>In addition, this section should describe:</p>  <ol>

<h3 className="reportHeading3"><a name="P341_23576"></a>3.6 Occupational health and safety</h3>  <p>The production and use of nuclear energy is under federal jurisdiction. The operation and management of a federal undertaking, including labour relations and working conditions, which are part of <span className="reportHeading3">occupational</span> health and safety (OHS), also fall under federal jurisdiction. However, OHS matters are normally under provincial jurisdiction; therefore, the regulation of OHS in nuclear power plants involves both federal and provincial jurisdictions: Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC), the CNSC and the various provincial ministries of labour. Under HRSDC, the <em>Canada Labour Code</em>, Part II, applies. However, in Ontario, the courts granted an exception to this rule, and provincial legislation concerning OHS has been incorporated by reference into the <em>Canada Labour Code. </em>A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is in place between the Province of Ontario and the Canadian federal government, whereby OHS matters in Ontario are governed by provincial requirements, on behalf of HRSDC.</p>  <p>In other provinces and territories, governance of OHS matters can only be determined on a case-by-case basis through analysis and identification of the applicable jurisdiction. Although OHS matters at nuclear facilities generally fall under the responsibility of the Labour Program at HRSDC, provincial licensee organizations that operate nuclear facilities benefit from provincial Crown immunity unless it is displaced by law. This effectively excludes federal jurisdiction over OHS matters at nuclear facilities operated by provincial licensee organizations. MOUs between the CNSC and provincial labour ministries, to formally establish jurisdiction over the administration of OHS matters, may be in place and must also be considered when reviewing any site licensee application.</p>  <p>This section of the application should demonstrate that the applicant&#8217;s proposed health and safety organization is adequate and that the applicant will:</p>  <ol>
<li> adequately execute the proposed worker health and safety policies and procedures</li>
<li> be qualified and make adequate provision for the protection of the health and safety of persons, including making provision to
<ol className="lower-alpha">
<li> demonstrate adequate oversight of the site OHS program</li>
<li> ensure compliance with applicable OHS regulations and requirements</li>
<li> ensure adequate OHS training of persons involved in site preparation activities</li>
<li> have the capabilities for reporting and investigating incidents and significant events</li>
</ol>
</li>  </ol>  <p>The proposed health and safety organization is expected to meet the requirements as set out in the applicable provincial or federal codes.</p>  <p>The CNSC expects applicants to develop, implement and maintain effective OHS programs and to take actions toward preventing occupational injuries and illnesses. Under the OHS program, applicants are also expected to identify potential OHS hazards, assess the associated risks, and put in place the necessary materials, equipment, programs and measures to effectively manage, control and minimize those risks. Applicants will also be expected to implement processes and procedures under the OHS program to:</p>  <ol>
<li> investigate incidents and significant events</li>
<li> identify root causes</li>
<li> implement corrective actions in order to eliminate the identified root causes</li>
<li>verify that the corrective actions are completed and will effectively prevent recurrence of the incident or significant event</li>  </ol>  <p>The <span className="reportHeading3">occupational</span> health and safety policies and procedures of the licensee, or contractors engaged by the licensee for purposes of site preparation, are expected to comply with applicable provincial requirements.</p>  <a name="4"></a>

<h3 className="reportHeading3"><a name="P1069_142395"></a>7.4 Human actions</h3>  <p>This section should describe and justify the approaches adopted to take into account human actions in the different types of safety analyses carried out, as well as the methods selected to model these actions in each analysis. The description should cover the relevant operating experience at other plants. Any information concerning human actions that is part of the safety analyses should also be covered in section 9.11, <em>Qualification and training of personnel</em>, and in section 9.12, <em>Certification of personnel</em>.</p>  <a name="7.5"></a>
<h3 className="reportHeading3"><a name="P1071_142925"></a>7.5 Deterministic safety analysis</h3>  <p>This section should describe the deterministic analyses conducted to meet the expectations of RD-310 to evaluate and justify plant safety.</p>  <p>The level of conservatism of each deterministic safety analysis should be appropriate for the class of event analysed and the analysis objectives. The analysis of anticipated operational occurrences (AOOs) conducted to demonstrate the capability of control systems (Level 2 defence&nbsp;in&nbsp;depth) may be of the &#8220;best estimate&#8221; type. The analysis of AOOs and design basis accidents (DBAs) conducted to demonstrate the capabilities of the safety systems (Level 3 defence&nbsp;in&nbsp;depth) should be sufficiently conservative to give a very high level of confidence that the acceptance criteria can be met by the action of safety systems acting alone. The analysis of beyond design basis accidents (BDBAs) may be less conservative than the analysis of DBAs. Best estimate codes are acceptable for deterministic analyses, provided they will be combined with a conservative selection of input data or will include evaluation of the uncertainties of the results.</p>  <p>The description should include models and the computer codes used for the deterministic analyses, as well as the general assumptions made concerning plant parameters, the operability of systems (including control systems), and the potential operators&#8217; actions in such events. Any important simplifications should be properly justified. The set of limiting assumptions for the safety analysis used in the deterministic safety analyses performed for the different types of PIEs should be identified and explained. This section should also describe the methods used to demonstrate that sufficient safety margins are achieved for PIEs of each classification.</p>  <p>A general summary of the verification and validation processes used for the computer codes should be provided and should include references to more detailed reports on the subject. All computer programs used should be identified, including references to the relevant supporting documentation. Emphasis should be placed on demonstrating the applicability of each computer program to a particular event, and reference should be made to the validation documentation. In turn, this documentation should refer to the relevant supporting experimental programs and/or actual plant operating data. The validation status of the plant model should also be presented.</p>  <p>This section should also describe any general guidelines for the analysis (such as on the choice of operating states of systems and/or support systems, conservative time delays, and operator actions) employed in setting up the methods and models used to demonstrate acceptability in the deterministic safety analyses.</p>  <a name="7.5.1"></a>
<h4 className="reportHeading4"><a name="P1077_145676"></a>7.5.1 Safety in normal operation</h4>  <p>This subsection should demonstrate that the normal plant operations can be carried out safely, thereby confirming that radiation doses to workers and members of the public, as well as any planned discharges and/or releases of radioactive material from the plant, will be within the authorized limits specified in the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em> and will meet the expectations of section 4.2.1 of RD-337.</p>  <p>All allowable conditions of normal operation should be analysed and described in this subsection. These should include:</p>  <ol>
<li> normal reactor start up (from shutdown, through criticality, to full power)</li>
<li> power operation, including full-power and low-power operation</li>

The analysis should cover the full range of events over the full range of reactor power. The analyses should also cover all normal operational configurations, including low-power and shutdown states.</p>  <p>For AOOs, the objective is to provide reasonable confidence that any deviations from normal operation can be detected, and that the control systems can be expected to return the plant to a safe state, normally without the activation of safety systems. For both AOOs and DBAs, there should be high confidence that safety systems acting alone can mitigate the event.</p>  <p>For each class of PIE it may be sufficient to analyse only a limited number of bounding initiating events, which can represent a bounding response for a group of events. The rationale for the choice of these selected bounding events should be provided in this subsection. The plant parameters that are important to the outcome of the safety analysis should also be identified. These parameters would typically include:</p>  <ol>
<li> reactor power and its distribution</li>
<li>core temperature</li>
<li> fuel cladding oxidation, and/or deformation</li>
<li> pressures in the primary and secondary systems</li>
<li> containment parameters</li>
<li> temperatures and flows</li>
<li> reactivity coefficients</li>
<li>reactor kinetics parameters</li>
<li> reactivity worth of reactivity devices</li>  </ol>  <p>Those characteristics of the safety systems, including the operating conditions in which the systems are actuated, the time delays, and the systems&#8217; capacity after the actuation claimed in the design, should be specified and demonstrated to be consistent with the overall functional requirements of the systems described in the application.</p>  <p>In some cases, different analyses may be necessary for a single PIE, in order to demonstrate that applicable, but different acceptance criteria are met. This subsection must show that all the relevant acceptance criteria for a particular PIE are met, and the results from all the necessary analyses should be explicitly included in the application.</p>  <a name="7.5.3"></a>
<h4 className="reportHeading4"><a name="P1104_149154"></a>7.5.3 Analysis of individual groups of postulated initiating events</h4>  <p>This subsection should provide the following information for each individual group of postulated initiating events (PIEs) analysed:</p>  <ol>

It should also include the evaluation of the design&#8217;s capability to meet the expectations contained in section 7.3.4 of RD-337. The choice of the BDBAs to be analysed should be explained and justified, indicating whether it has been made on the basis of a PSA or according to another fault analysis that identifies potential vulnerabilities of the plant.</p>  <p>Events in this category are typically sequences involving more than one failure (unless they are taken into account in the DBAs at the design stage), such as plant blackout, design basis events with degraded performance of a safety system, and sequences that lead to containment bypass and/or confinement bypass. The analyses may:</p>  <ol>
<li> use best estimate models and assumptions</li>
<li> take credit for realistic system action and performance, including non-safety-related systems</li>
<li> take credit for realistic operator actions</li>  </ol>  <p>Where this is not possible, reasonably conservative assumptions should be made in which the uncertainties in the understanding of the physical processes being modelled are taken into account. The subsection should describe, explain and justify the approach taken.</p>  <p>The format and content of the analyses of BDBAs to be presented here should be consistent with the presentation of the analyses for anticipated operational occurrences and design basis events, with the following modifications:</p>  <ol>
<li> objective of the analysis of BDBAs and/or the specific acceptance criteria should be stated</li>

<h3 className="reportHeading3"><a name="P1147_155145"></a>7.6 Severe accidents</h3>  <p>This section should provide detailed information concerning the analysis performed to identify accidents that can lead to significant core damage, and/or off-site releases of radioactive material (severe accidents). In addition, this section should describe the evaluation that has been carried out on the capability of complementary plant design features to meet the expectations contained in section 7.3.4 and section 8.6.12 of RD-337. The challenges to the plant presented by such events, and the extent to which the design may be reasonably expected to mitigate their consequences, should also be considered, justified and referenced here, and should meet expectations stated in G-306.</p>  <p>The information should include an explanation of the analysis performed for severe accident sequences, including hydrogen fire, steam explosion and molten fuel-coolant interaction. The results of the most relevant severe accident analyses used in the development of the accident management programs and emergency preparedness planning for the plant should also be described in this section.</p>  <p>The results of the severe accident analysis need to be taken into account in the accident management measures that should be carried out to mitigate the effects of accidents, and in emergency planning and preparedness. (Refer to section 9.5, <em>Operating procedures</em>, and section 9.6, <em>Accident management</em>, regarding accident management programs and procedures.)</p>  <a name="7.7"></a>

The results should be presented in a manner that clearly conveys the quantitative risk measures taken, and the aspects of the plant design and operation that are the most important contributors to these risk measures. This section should identify and refer to the completed plant PSA as a separate document, which should accompany the application.</p>  <p>A comparison of the main PSA results with the expectations for safety goals, contained in section 4.2.2 of RD-337, should be provided to demonstrate compliance.</p>  <a name="7.8"></a>
<h3 className="reportHeading3"><a name="P1161_158798"></a>7.8 Hazard analysis</h3>  <p>RD-346, RD-337, and S-294 address the expectations concerning hazard analyses.

The hazards that make an insignificant contribution to plant risk can be screened out from the detailed analysis, but the rationale for this screening should be given. The remaining PIEs constitute the scope of the hazard analysis.</p>  <p>The hazards included in the scope of detailed analysis should be sorted, with the purpose of identifying specific design basis hazards. Clear criteria should be established for this process, and they must be described in detail. The design basis hazards should be analyzed using the deterministic techniques listed in section 7.5, <em>Deterministic safety analysis</em> and the expectations of RD-337. However, according to section7.7, <em>Probabilistic safety assessment,</em> and to S-294, all hazards should be analyzed when using probabilistic techniques. The detailed analyses and their results should be documented in the appropriate deterministic and probabilistic parts of the Safety Analysis Report (see section 7.9, <em>Summary of the results of the safety analysis</em>).</p>  <a name="7.9"></a>

<h3 className="reportHeading3"><a name="P1634_249997"></a>16.1 General considerations</h3>  <p>This chapter should describe the safeguards approach and the implementing infrastructure to be followed at the plant by the applicant. These should have been established in consultation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the CNSC. The approach and infrastructure should be sufficient to enable the CNSC (which is the designated federal agency responsible for implementing the agreements for the application of Canadian safeguards) to ensure conformity with Canada&#8217;s international safeguards obligations under the United Nations <em>Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons</em>. Pursuant to the treaty, the Government of Canada has entered into a safeguards agreement with the IAEA, and a protocol additional to the agreement.</p>  <p>The agreement and additional protocol give the IAEA the right and the responsibility to verify that Canada is fulfilling its international commitment concerning the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The safeguards approach described in this chapter should facilitate IAEA verification activities at the plant. The CNSC provides the general mechanisms, through the <em>NSCA</em>, the <em>General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations</em> and plant licences for the IAEA to carry out its role under the safeguards agreement and additional protocol. The essential requirements for the application of IAEA safeguards are inscribed in specific conditions that form part of the plant licence when it is issued.</p>  <p>To comply with regulatory requirements, the safeguards approach and implementing infrastructure described in this chapter should provide for the following:</p>  <ol>
<li> timely and accurate provision of reports on nuclear materials</li>
<li> provision of access and assistance to IAEA inspectors for verification activities</li>
<li> submission of annual operational information and accurate design information of plant structures, processes and procedures</li>
<li> development and satisfactory implementation of appropriate facility safeguards procedures</li>  </ol>  <p>The description given in this chapter should specifically detail the arrangements made by the applicant, that will permit the CNSC to discharge Canada&#8217;s treaty obligation to provide information to the IAEA about site buildings and structures, operational parameters, and the flow and storage of nuclear material, from the plant&#8217;s design and commissioning phases through to its decommissioning and eventual abandonment. </p>  <p>This chapter should indicate how the applicant already has and will continue, to work cooperatively with both the CNSC and the IAEA in the development and implementation of an appropriate safeguards approach, based on the plant&#8217;s specific design. </p>  <p>The information provided should also explain how the safeguards equipment installations have been taken into account at an early stage in the plant design. It should also detail the infrastructure that has been established for the safeguards approach (e.g., plant procedures in place, operations and security staff trained) prior to the introduction of nuclear material at the close of commissioning Phase A.</p>

<dd>The responsible organization that will operate the plant. This organization may be the applicant, or may be an organization that will operate the plant on behalf of the applicant. In this case, the applicant must supervise the activities of the operating organization.</dd>
<dt>operation</dt>
<dd>All activities performed to achieve the purpose for which a facility was constructed. For nuclear power plants, this includes maintenance, refuelling, in-service inspection and other associated activities.</dd>
<dt>operational limits and conditions</dt>
<dd>A set of rules setting forth parameter limits and the functional capability and performance levels of equipment and personnel, which are approved by the regulatory body for safe operation of an authorized facility.</dd>
<dt>operational states</dt>
<dd>States defined under normal operation and anticipated operational occurrences.</dd>
<dt>plant states</dt>
<dd>A configuration of nuclear power plant components, including the physical and thermodynamic states of the materials and the process fluids in them.<br/>
Note: For the purpose of this document, a plant is said to be in one of the following states: normal operation, anticipated operational occurrence, design basis accident, or beyond design basis accident (severe accidents are a subset of the beyond design basis state).</dd>
<dt>postulated initiating event (PIE)</dt>
<dd>An event identified during design as capable of leading to anticipated operational occurrences or accident conditions.</dd>
<dt>protective zone</dt>
<dd>The area beyond the exclusion zone that needs to be considered with respect to implementing emergency measures.</dd>
<dt>reactor protection system</dt>
<dd>System which monitors the operation of a reactor and which, on sensing an abnormal condition, automatically initiates actions to prevent an unsafe or potentially unsafe condition.</dd>
<dt>regulation</dt>
<dd>The legal requirements prescribed in the <em>Nuclear Safety and Control Act</em>, its regulations, and site-specific licence conditions.</dd>
<dt>safety case</dt>
<dd>An integrated collection of arguments and evidence to demonstrate&nbsp;the safety of the facility and that all applicable regulatory requirements are met.</dd>
<dt>safety function</dt>
<dd>A specific purpose that needs to be accomplished for safety.</dd>
<dt>safety system</dt>
<dd>A system important to safety, provided to ensure the safe shutdown of the reactor or the residual heat removal from the core, or to limit the consequences of anticipated operational occurrences and design basis accidents.</dd>
<dt>severe accident</dt>
<dd>Accident conditions more severe than a design basis accident and involving significant core degradation.</dd>
<dt>single failure</dt>
<dd>A failure which results in the loss of capability of a component to perform its intended safety function(s), and any consequential failure(s) which result from it.</dd>
<dt>single failure criterion</dt>
<dd>A criterion (or requirement) applied to a system such that it will be capable of performing its task in the presence of any single failure.</dd>  </dl>

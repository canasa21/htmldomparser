<h2 className="reportHeading2">Preface</h2>  <p>This guidance document provides details of the information that nuclear power plant (NPP) licensees are to report to the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) as specified in conditions of applicable operating licences. </p>  <p>This document provides direction and clarification to the mandatory reporting requirements, and information important to the public, that requires immediate notification. Information for lower safety significance situations or events is also captured for follow-up reporting, scheduled reporting, management control and necessary actions, audit, and program review. Reporting requirements are expected to be fulfilled using best management practices and objective-based and risk-assessment principles, in alignment with RD-99.1, industry norms such as CSA N286-05, <em>Management System Requirements for Nuclear Power Plants</em>.</p>  <p><br />
<em>Reporting Requirements for Operating Nuclear Power Plants: Events.</em>RD-99.1 sets out the types of reports and the frequency and the applicable timeframes for reporting. Reporting timeframe is determined by the safety significance of the event; for example, high safety significance events are reported immediately to the CNSC.</p>  <p>This document is a part of a suite of regulatory documents providing event and routine compliance monitoring reporting requirements, and the public information and disclosure requirements for nuclear facilities. Each regulatory document is accompanied by a complementary guidance document. </p>  <p>This document contains guidance, explanatory information, forms and templates provided by the CNSC to assist users in meeting the requirements of RD-99.1. </p>  <p>The reporting program provided in this suite of documents is intended to enable the CNSC and industry to track, trend, and analyze situations and events, and to develop improvement initiatives. </p>  <p>Key principles and elements used in developing this document are consistent with national and international standards.<br />  </p>  <p>Nothing contained in this document shall be construed as relieving any licensee from pertinent requirements. It is the licensee&#8217;s responsibility to identify and comply with all applicable regulations and licence conditions.</p>

<h2 className="reportHeading2"><a name="P105_4405" id="P105_4405"></a>1.0 Introduction</h2>  <a name="1.1"></a>
<h3 className="reportHeading3"><a name="P107_4419" id="P107_4419"></a>1.1 Purpose</h3>  <p>This document provides value-added direction and best practice guidance on the implementation of the reporting requirements set out in RD-99.1, <em>Reporting Requirements for Operating Nuclear Power Plants: Events</em>. Rationale, underlying guidance, and examples are provided.</p>  <p>This document provides guidance on the extent of event reporting, the expected level of detail, and the appropriateness, completeness, and timeliness of information which is reported to the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) by licensees of nuclear power plants (NPPs) pursuant to RD-99.1, <em>Reporting Requirements for Operating Nuclear Power Plants: Events</em>.</p>  <a name="1.2"></a>
<h3 className="reportHeading3"><a name="P113_5062" id="P113_5062"></a>1.2 Scope</h3>  <p>This guidance document clarifies regulatory requirements by providing how-to information, process and procedural guidance, and examples of industry best practice; it does not create additional requirements beyond those contained in RD-99.1.</p>  <a name="1.3"></a>
<h3 className="reportHeading3"><a name="P117_5311" id="P117_5311"></a>1.3 Relevant legislation and regulations</h3>  <p>The following provisions of the <em>Nuclear Safety and Control Act </em>(NSCA), the <em>General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations </em>(GNSCR), the <em>Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations </em>(CINFR)<em>, </em>the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations </em>(RPR), the<em> Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices Regulations </em>(NSRDR), the<em> Packaging and Transport of Nuclear Substances Regulations </em>(PTNSR)<em> </em>and the<em> Nuclear Security Regulations </em>(NSR) are relevant to this document:</p>  <ul>
<li> Subsections 24(1) and 24(5) of the NSCA give the CNSC the authority to establish classes of licences and to include in those licences any terms or conditions that the CNSC considers necessary for the purposes that are laid out in section 3 of the NSCA. Pursuant to this authority, the CNSC has established operating licences for NPPs and, for the purposes of the NSCA, proposes to incorporate this document into these licences.</li>
<li>Paragraph 27(<em>b</em>) of the NSCA requires every licensee and every prescribed person to make the prescribed reports and to file them in the prescribed manner. In accordance with section 2 of the NSCA, &#8220;prescribed&#8221; means prescribed by regulation of the CNSC. Accordingly, this paragraph obliges licensees who operate an NPP to file reports in accordance with any relevant requirements established by the CNSC.</li>
<li>Subsection 9(4) of the GNSCR requires persons who carry on an activity without a licence in accordance with subsections 9(1) and (2) of the GNSCR to immediately notify the CNSC.</li>
<li>Section 15 of the GNSCR stipulates that every licensee shall notify the CNSC of (a) the persons who have authority to act for the licensee in the licensee&#8217;s dealings with the CNSC; (b) the names and position titles of the persons who are responsible for the management and control of the licensed activity; and (c) any change in the information referred to in (a) and (b) within 15 days after the change occurs.</li>
<li>Section 28 of the GNSCR outlines the reporting requirements and procedure for record keeping and their disposal as required by the Act, the regulations made under the Act or a licence. A person who notifies the CNSC in accordance with subsection (2) shall file the record, or a copy of the record, with the CNSC at its request.</li>
<li>Sections 29, 30, and 31 of the GNSCR specify general, safeguards and record deficiency reporting requirements.</li>
<li>Section 32 of the GNSCR requires every report to include the name and address of the sender, as well as the date on which it was completed. The section also defines the date of the filing of a report to be the date that the report is received by the CNSC.</li>
<li>Paragraph 6(2)(<em>c</em>) of the RPR requires a licensee (including an operator of an NPP) to notify the CNSC, within the period specified in the licence, when the licensee becomes aware that an action level referred to in the licence has been reached.</li>
<li> Paragraph 16(<em>a</em>) of the RPR requires that, when a licensee becomes aware that a dose of radiation received by and committed to a person or an organ or tissue may have exceeded an applicable dose limit prescribed by section 13, 14, or 15, the licensee shall immediately notify the person and the CNSC of the dose. In accordance with paragraph 16(<em>e</em>) of the same regulations, the licensee shall also report to the CNSC, within 21 days after becoming aware that the dose limit has been exceeded, the results of the investigation or on the progress that has been made in conducting the investigation in accordance with paragraph 16<em>(c)</em>.</li>
<li>Subparagraphs 6(<em>k</em>)(ii) and 6(<em>k</em>)(iii) of the CINFR require licensees to notify and report information on any accidental or imminent accidental releases to offsite authorities. Paragraphs 12(1)(<em>e</em>) and (<em>f</em>) of the GNSCR sets out obligations consistent with such notification and reporting.</li>
<li>Subsections 18(3) and 30(2) of the NSRDR capture situations related to exposure devices or sealed sources that require notification and reporting. Sections 35 and 38 of the same regulations are related to notifying and reporting situations for nuclear substances and radiation devices.</li>
<li>Sections 19, 21, and 22 of the PTNSR provide the notification and reporting requirements for events concerning transportation of nuclear substances and radiation devices.</li>
<li>Subsection 7.5(4) of the NSR pertains to threat and risk assessment reporting to the CNSC within 60 days after completion of the assessment. In addition, sections 21, 36 and subsection 44(2) provide requirements for notification for other nuclear security-related events.</li>  </ul>  <a name="2.0"></a>
<h2 className="reportHeading2"><a name="P147_9840" id="P147_9840"></a>2.0 Reporting Requirements</h2>  <p>Reports are submitted to the CNSC in order to: </p>  <ul>
<li>help the CNSC collect the information it needs to verify that the licensee is complying with regulatory requirements and is operating the NPP safely</li>
<li>enable the CNSC to take timely and appropriate action in response to licensee non-compliance or unforeseen circumstances</li>
<li>permit CNSC staff to compile the data necessary to perform trend analysis</li>  </ul>  <p>The reporting requirements specified in RD-99.1 are consistent with the safety significance of the situation or event. This document provides guidance for determining the safety significance of situations or events according to the classification criteria given in table 1. Engineering analysis and assessment and/or management judgement will be needed to effectively apply the criteria.</p>  <p>The safety significance classification grading table (table 1) was developed using the methodology for risk estimation and evaluation of risk-informed decision making. Risk significance levels (RSLs) for events consider consequence and likelihood matrices for four scenarios, namely:</p>  <ul>
<li>radiological risk to the public at a design basis accident (DBA)</li>
<li> risk of negative impact to safety</li>
<li> health and safety risks to workers </li>
<li>risks to the environment due to radioactive releases and spills of hazardous substances</li>  </ul>  <a name="2.1"></a>
<h3 className="reportHeading3"><a name="P164_11169" id="P164_11169"></a>2.1 General requirements</h3>  <p>Situations and events that are of low safety significance are reported routinely under the RD-99 document suite. Early or immediate reporting is limited to situations or events that are of higher regulatory or safety significance classification grading that may require timely action by the CNSC. </p>  <p>The reporting classification criteria allows both licensees and CNSC staff to focus on important day-to-day issues associated with operating a NPP, rather than on less significant situations or events. </p>  <p>Tables 2 and 3 list situations or events that require reports or notifications. The contents of the required reports or notifications are specified in the applicable legislative (statutory and regulatory) instrument. </p>  <p>Where reports are to be filed or submitted to the CNSC as required throughout this document, they are to be provided to the CNSC designated officer or delegate, except where otherwise directed. At the time of publication, the CNSC designated officer is the Regulatory Program Director of the Directorate of Power Reactor Regulation.</p>  <a name="2.2"></a>
<h3 className="reportHeading3"><a name="P174_12242" id="P174_12242"></a>2.2 Requirements for unscheduled reporting</h3>  <a name="2.2.1"></a>
<h4 className="reportHeading4"><a name="P176_12284" id="P176_12284"></a>2.2.1 Situations and events that require preliminary and detailed reports </h4>  <p>This section provides clarification and examples for some of the reporting requirements in RD-99.1. The following explanatory notes address the reporting requirements by the headings or by the specific reference numbers found in RD-99.1.</p>  <p>RD-99.1 requires that licensees provide preliminary reports for situations and events. A preliminary report is made either orally (to be followed by a written report) or directly in writing, as follows:</p>  <ul>
<li> if required immediately, the report is made to CNSC duty officer, or </li>
<li>if required the next normal business day or within five normal business days, the report is made to the onsite CNSC staff</li>  </ul>  <p>Templates that may be used to prepare an oral preliminary report, a preliminary report and detailed reports (1) and (2) are available on the CNSC Web site at nuclearsafety.gc.ca. </p>  <p>Guidance on the criteria for situations and events requiring a preliminary and detailed report as specified in RD-99.1 can be found in table 4. This information is based on previous experience where additional explanation and scenarios may be useful. </p>  <p>Examples of events that may require the submission of an immediate preliminary report include a declared station emergency, a large loss of coolant accident (LOCA), a generator fire, or terrorist activity at the NPP. </p>  <p>Licensees are expected to use the item numbers of table 1 of RD-99.1 that best correspond to the reported situation or event. If required, the licensee may report using multiple item numbers for the same single report.</p>  <a name="2.2.1.1"></a>
<p><em><strong><a name="P193_13861"></a>2.2.1.1 Submitting preliminary reports</strong></em></p>  <p>It is the licensee&#8217;s responsibility to determine the safety significance of the situations or events and report according to the timeframes given in RD-99.1. </p>  <p>For situations and events where the licensee requires additional time to determine whether a report is necessary, the licensee submits the report no later than one day after the management review meeting immediately following the occurrence of the situation or event.</p>  <p>If, after further investigation, the licensee believes that the event was not reportable, the licensee may provide a written justification to the appropriate CNSC designated officer or delegate to request the retraction of the report and the reclassification of the event as non-safety significant.</p>  <p>The licensee-determined risk and safety significance classification is reviewed by the appropriate CNSC designated officer or delegate. Discrepancies in risk and safety significance classification will be resolved by formal or informal correspondence, meetings, and/or inspection of the licensee&#8217;s reporting process.</p>  <a name="2.2.1.2"></a>
<p><em><strong><a name="P203_14942"></a>2.2.1.2 Contents of preliminary reports</strong></em></p>  <p>For RD-99.1 section 2.2.1.2 item (e), the rationale for the safety-significance classification level would be provided through the use of table 1 or the licensee&#8217;s methodology.</p>  <p>For RD-99.1 section 2.2.1.2 item (f), for the occurrence of an event involving an unauthorized release to the environment of a nuclear substance, the preliminary report contains the name of the substance, the estimated or measured quantity released, the estimated or measured rate of release, and the manner of the release.</p>  <a name="2.2.1.3"></a>
<p><em><strong><a name="P209_15482"></a>2.2.1.3 Submitting detailed reports</strong></em></p>  <p>If it is determined by the licensee that no further relevant information on the cause of the event&nbsp;could be obtained from further analysis, then the licensee is not required to submit a detailed report. In this case, the preliminary report will serve as the regulatory closeout of the event.</p>  <p>If CNSC determines that more information should have been required for&nbsp;events where the licensee has not submitted a detailed report, formal and informal discussion between the CNSC and the licensee may be necessary for final resolution.</p>  <p>If, after further investigation, the licensee believes that the event was not reportable, the licensee may provide written justification to the CNSC designated officer or delegate requesting the retraction of the report. </p>  <p>If the licensee requires an extension for submitting a detailed report, the licensee may provide informal written notification with reason to, and may receive concurrence from, the CNSC designated officer or delegate. </p>  <a name="2.2.1.4"></a>
<p><em><strong><a name="P221_16487"></a>2.2.1.4 Contents of detailed reports</strong></em></p>  <p>No further guidance is needed at this time.</p>  <a name="2.2.2"></a>

<p><em><strong><a name="P231_16717"></a>2.2.2.2 Performance and status of certified personnel reports</strong></em></p>  <p>The reporting requirement for the performance and status of certified personnel originates from the following sections of RD-204 (<em>Certification of Persons Working at Nuclear Power Plants</em>):</p>  <ol>
<li>removal of a certified person from their duties is required under section 12.0. The basis for removal include:</li>
<ol className="lower-roman">
<li>failure of a re-qualification test as per subsection 12.1</li>
<li>failure to perform minimum sift duties as per subsection 12.2</li>
<li>inability to perform duties because of limitations in fitness for duty as per subsection 12.3</li>
<li>pending decertification as per subsection 12.4</li>
</ol>
<li>reinstatement of a certified person to their duties is required under section 13.0</li>
<li>temporary assignments of a certified person to a position for which they are not certified are specified under section 14.0; operationally focused assignments consist of activities that utilize the knowledge and skills of a certified person and therefore maintaining their competence unlike non-operationally focused assignments </li>  </ol>  <a name="2.2.2.3"></a>
<p> <em><strong> <a name="P243_17769"></a>2.2.2.3 Reports of problems identified by research findings or revised analyses</strong></em></p>  <p>No further guidance is needed at this time.</p>

<p>Licensees report relief devices that fail to open or open at a pressure above the hydrostatic test pressure under this item via preliminary and detailed reports. However, RD-99.1 allows licensees to exclude certain relief device degradations from unscheduled reporting. Under these circumstances, the licensee reports these relief device degradations under paragraph 2.2.1.4 (d) of RD-99.2. Licensees should note that the maximum set point is the one currently in use for the system and not necessarily its design pressure; that is, the maximum set point may be lower than the design pressure.

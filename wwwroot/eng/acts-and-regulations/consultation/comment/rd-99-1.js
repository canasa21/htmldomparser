<h2 className="reportHeading2">Preface</h2>  <p>This regulatory document details the information that nuclear power plant (NPP) licensees are to report to the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) to support the conditions of applicable operating licences. The document gives the types of event reports, the frequency and the applicable timeframe for reporting (reporting timeframes are determined by the safety significance of the event). </p>  <p>This regulatory document replaces S-99, <em>Reporting Requirements for Operating Nuclear Power Plants</em>, published in March 2003. </p>  <p>This regulatory document has a companion guidance document entitled GD-99.1, <em>Guide to the Reporting Requirements for Operating Nuclear Power Plant: Events.</em> GD-99.1 contains guidance, explanatory information, forms and templates provided by the CNSC to assist users in meeting the requirements of RD-99.1. </p>  <p>This document is a part of a suite of regulatory documents providing event and routine compliance monitoring reporting requirements, and the public information and disclosure requirements for nuclear facilities. Each regulatory document is accompanied by a complementary guidance document. </p>  <p>Key principles and elements used in developing this document are consistent with national and international standards.</p>  <p>Nothing contained in this document is to be construed as relieving any licensee from pertinent requirements. It is the licensee&#8217;s responsibility to identify and comply with all applicable regulations and licence conditions.</p>

Pursuant to this authority, the CNSC has established operating licences for NPPs and, for the purposes of the NSCA, proposes to incorporate this document into these licences.</li>
<li>Paragraph 27(<em>b</em>) of the NSCA requires every licensee and every prescribed person to make the prescribed reports and to file them in the prescribed manner. In accordance with section 2 of the NSCA, &#8220;prescribed&#8221; means prescribed by regulation of the CNSC. Accordingly, this paragraph obliges licensees who operate an NPP, to file reports in accordance with any relevant requirements established by the CNSC.</li>
<li>Subsection 9(4) of the GNSCR requires persons who carry on an activity without a licence in accordance with subsections 9(1) and 9(2) of the GNSCR to immediately notify the CNSC.</li>
<li> Section 15 of the GNSCR stipulates that every licensee shall notify the CNSC of (a) the persons who have authority to act for the licensee in the licensee&#8217;s dealings with the CNSC; (b) the names and position titles of the persons who are responsible for the management and control of the licensed activity; and (c) any change in the information referred to in (a) and (b) within 15 days after the change occurs.</li>
<li> Section 28 of the GNSCR outlines the reporting requirements and procedure for record keeping and their disposal as required by the Act, the regulations made under the Act or a licence. A person who notifies the CNSC in accordance with subsection (2) shall file the record, or a copy of the record, with the CNSC at its request.</li>
<li>Sections 29, 30, and 31 of the GNSCR specify general, safeguards and record deficiency reporting requirements.</li>
<li>Section 32 of the GNSCR requires every report to include the name and address of the sender as well as the date on which it was completed. The section also defines the date of the filing of a report to be the date that the report is received by the CNSC.</li>
<li>Paragraph 6(2)(<em>c</em>) of the RPR requires a licensee (including an operator of an NPP) to notify the CNSC, within the period specified in the licence, when the licensee becomes aware that an action level referred to in the licence has been reached.</li>
<li>Paragraph 16(<em>a</em>) of the RPR requires that, when a licensee becomes aware that a dose of radiation received by and committed to a person, organ or tissue may have exceeded an applicable dose limit prescribed by section 13, 14 or 15, the licensee shall immediately notify the person and the CNSC of the dose. In accordance with paragraph 16(<em>e</em>) of the same regulations, the licensee shall also report to the CNSC, within 21 days after becoming aware that the dose limit has been exceeded, the results of the investigation or on the progress that has been made in conducting the investigation in accordance with paragraph 16<em>(c)</em>.</li>
<li>Subparagraphs 6(<em>k</em>)(ii) and 6(<em>k</em>)(iii) of the CINFR require licensees to notify and report information on any accidental or imminent accidental releases to off-site authorities. Paragraphs 12(1)(<em>e</em>) and (<em>f</em>) of the GNSCR sets out obligations consistent with such notification and reporting.</li>

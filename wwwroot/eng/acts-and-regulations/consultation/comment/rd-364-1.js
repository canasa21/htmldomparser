<a name="F"></a>  	<h2><strong>F. APPLICATION CONTENT GUIDANCE</strong></h2>
<a name="1.0"></a>  	<h2><strong>1.0 GENERAL INFORMATION</strong></h2>  <p>This section of the application should present an introduction and a general description of the package. The applicant should also specify that the application is intended to meet the regulatory requirements of the CNSC regulations, namely the PTNS Regulations which refer to IAEA TS-R-1, 1996 (Revised), and the NRC&#8217;s 10&nbsp;CFR&nbsp;Part&nbsp;71. As indicated in this guide, the application should demonstrate that the package meets the more stringent of the two. In the following text, shaded boxes identify the more stringent requirements where there are significant differences. If the approval is only sought for one of the two countries, this guide may not apply. </p>  <p>The purpose of the application should be clearly stated. The application may be for approval of a new design, for modification of an approved design, or for renewal of an existing approval. Applications for a new design should be whole and complete and should contain the information required in Subpart&nbsp;D, <em>Application for Package Approval</em>, of 10&nbsp;CFR&nbsp;Part&nbsp;71 and Section&nbsp;VI of TS-R-1 which is referenced in Subsection 1(4) of the PTNS Regulations, as applicable. </p>  <p>Applications for modification of an approved design should clearly identify the changes being requested. Modifications may include design changes, changes in authorized contents, or changes in conditions of the approval. Design changes should be clearly identified in revised packaging drawings. The application should include an assessment of the changes and justification that these changes do not affect the ability of the package to meet the regulatory requirements. Applications for modifications may be subject to the provisions of 10&nbsp;CFR&nbsp;71.19, <em>Previously Approved Package</em>, and Paragraphs&nbsp;816 and 817 of TS-R-1 as referenced in Paragraph&nbsp;16(1)(<em>a</em>)(viii) of the PTNS Regulations. For package designs approved prior to this guide becoming effective, revised package applications may be submitted for approval under this guide.</p>  <p>Packaging that does not conform to the drawings referenced in the design approval is not authorized for use. Likewise, only contents specified in the approval may be transported. Package operations, acceptance tests, and the maintenance program may also be specified as conditions of the approval.</p>
<a name="1.1"></a>  	<h3><strong>1.1 Introduction</strong></h3>  <p>This section should identify the proposed use of the package, the model number, and, in the case of fissile material packages, the proposed criticality safety index (CSI) and the value of &#8220;N&#8221;, as defined in 10&nbsp;CFR&nbsp;71.59, <em>Standards for Arrays of Fissile Material Packages</em>, and Paragraph&nbsp;681 of TS-R-1 which is incorporated in Subsection 1(1) of the PTNS Regulations by reference to Paragraph&nbsp;672 of TS-R-1.

<h2 id="sec2">2. Reporting Requirements</h2>  <p>The following reporting requirements apply to Class II nuclear facilities and users of prescribed equipment, nuclear substances and radiation devices licensees:</p>
<ol>
<li>After determining if a situation, event or dangerous occurrence is reportable, the licensee shall immediately notify, or make a preliminary report to, the Commission.</li>
<li>The licensee shall file a report to the Commission in response to an event, a situation or a dangerous occurrence.</li>
<li>As required, licensees shall provide other notifications or reports, including a failure to comply with section 26 of the PTNSR, 2015.</li>
<li>All reports filed by the licensee shall contain the name and address of the sender of the report, and the date the report was submitted to the Commission.</li>
<li>The licensee shall report on the licence conditions listed in appendix A of this document as applicable to the licensee.</li>
<li>A full report, preliminary report or notification shall:
<ul className="list-lower-alpha">
<li>contain the specific information required by the reporting provision; see sections 3.1, 3.2 and appendix A for guidance</li>
<li>be submitted within the time frames as required by the reporting provision; see appendix A for guidance</li>
</ul></li>  	</ol>  <h3>Guidance</h3>  <p>The NSCA and the regulations made under the NSCA state that reports are submitted to "the Commission". In terms of submitting reports and notifications, "the Commission" is understood to be the CNSC. If needed, reporting parties should contact their CNSC point of contact for information on how to submit any particular report. Once a report is submitted, the point of contact may contact the licensee if more information is required.</p>  <p>Appendix A lists the situations, events and dangerous occurrences that require a report or notification, along with time frames for providing the respective reports or notifications.</p>   <p>The first priority for any situation, event or dangerous occurrence is to ensure that reasonable measures have been taken to mitigate the potential consequences for the health and safety of persons or the environment, or for security. For reporting requirements involving "immediate" notification of the Commission, notification should occur as soon as practicable after the licensee becomes aware that a situation, event or dangerous occurrence is reportable and has taken reasonable mitigation measures. Complete remediation of the situation or event is not required prior to reporting.</p>   <p>A preliminary report or notification that must be submitted immediately may only be provided in person or by telephone to either the duty officer through the emergency telephone number at 613-995-0479 (or toll-free at 1-844-879-0805), or the licensee&rsquo;s CNSC point of contact, depending on the situation, event or dangerous occurrence. Table A indicates to whom licensees should send their preliminary reports. Note that a licensee should speak to someone; leaving a voicemail or sending an email is not acceptable. Further information on reporting is available on the CNSC website.</p>  <p>Full reports that do not include prescribed information (e.g., security issues) may be filed by email, fax or regular mail. All related information required under the regulations or a licence condition may also be submitted in electronic format (e.g., emails with pdf attachments, scanned copies of documents and photographs). Note: Prescribed information must not be transmitted electronically.</p>  <p>Licensees should report any of the following events to the CNSC, directly through the duty officer: an event or incident that triggers actions under emergency response programs, even if it is a false alarm; an event such as a spill, a release or an injury that could trigger stakeholder interest; an event that falls under the reporting requirements of subsection 29(1) of the <em>General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations</em>.</p>  <p>The licensee should make all reasonable efforts to obtain timely information that has been reviewed for accuracy when filing a report to the CNSC. For reports of situations or events that have not attained stability and predictability, timeliness of informing CNSC staff of the situation or event should be prioritized over the availability of data and/or information.</p>  <p>A situation, event or dangerous occurrence that triggers multiple reporting provisions may be amalgamated into a single report at the licensee&rsquo;s discretion.</p>  <p>A situation, event or dangerous occurrence that triggers reporting by multiple parties may be amalgamated into a single report, subject to the approval of the CNSC.</p>  <p>Licensees should use the reporting provisions of table A that best correspond to the situation(s), event(s) or dangerous occurrence(s).</p>  <p>Flexibility is allowed for integrated/harmonized reporting. For example, if a licensee is required to submit reports to regulatory bodies other than the CNSC, then sending a copy of the report to the CNSC is acceptable provided the copied report contains all of the reporting information required by the CNSC. This option allows the licensee to avoid duplication of effort and to minimize the administrative burden.</p>  <p>If, after further investigation, the licensee concludes that a situation or event was not reportable, the licensee may provide the CNSC with a written statement that includes a rationale to support this conclusion.</p>   <p>If the licensee determines that investigation beyond the preliminary report is unlikely to yield further relevant details or identify additional corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the situation or event, then a full report may not be necessary. In this case, the preliminary report should include the information that would have been required in the full report.</p>  <p>Licensees may use the situation or event reporting according to this regulatory document as input to their public disclosure protocol as applicable.</p>  <p>Each report should be unclassified and should not contain any proprietary business information so it can be made available to the public upon request. Information should be considered public for the most part. Any information considered classified, protected, proprietary or personal should be submitted with the appropriate security precautions and marked with appropriate protection and classification.</p>

<h3 id="sec3-1">3.1	Preliminary reports and immediate notifications</h3>  <p>Both a preliminary report and an immediate notification of a situation, event or dangerous occurrence shall contain the following information, as applicable:</p>
<ol>
<li>the location</li>
<li>the circumstances, including:
<ul className="list-lower-alpha">
<li>a description of the situation, event or dangerous occurrence</li>
<li>date and time of the onset and the duration (if known), or date and time of discovery (if the time of occurrence is not known)</li>

</ul></li>
<li>a description of any actions taken or proposed to mitigate the situation, event or dangerous occurrence and reestablish control of the nuclear substance or prescribed equipment</li>
<li>confirmation that any workers who were exposed to radiation as a consequence of the situation have stopped any work that is likely to add to the dose of the worker (this includes any work outside of the situation, event or dangerous occurrence that has the potential to add to the dose of the worker)</li>  	</ol>  <h4>Guidance</h4>  <p>A notification refers to the obligation to inform the CNSC of situations where no further reporting (such as a full report) is required. However, if further reporting is necessary, the licensee should submit a preliminary report instead.</p>  <p>The preliminary report typically contains preliminary, readily available or provisional information on the situation, event or dangerous occurrence being reported. Without compromising safety or recovery, it is important to begin the data collection phase immediately following the situation, event or dangerous occurrence to ensure that data is not lost. The information that should be collected consists of conditions before, during and after the situation, event or dangerous occurrence; personnel involvement (including actions taken); environmental factors; and other information having relevance to the situation, event or dangerous occurrence.</p>  <p>If the licensee has additional information on the situation, event or dangerous occurrence (such as descriptions of any nuclear substances, radiation devices, prescribed equipment or packages), they should include it in the preliminary report or notification.</p>   <p>If available, preliminary reports should contain enough information such that CNSC staff have an understanding of the effects of the situation, event or dangerous occurrence on the health, safety and security of Canadians and the environment.</p>   <p>Contact information should be provided with a preliminary report or immediate notification along with the names of the persons involved in the situation.</p>

<p><strong>Guidance</strong><br />
Limits are provided under the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em> (RPR), sections 13, 14 and 15. An example of when an event is "likely" to result in an exposure in excess of a limit is where there is a reason to believe that a regulatory dose limit may be exceeded but has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<p>The CNSC&rsquo;s expectations for the reporting of skin contamination incidents is that only instances in which the dose exceeds 10 percent of the corresponding dose limit must be reported. An <a href="http://www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/pdfs/cnsc-expectations-for-licensee-response-during-skin-contamination-events-eng.pdf">information document</a> on this subject is available on the CNSC&rsquo;s website.</p>

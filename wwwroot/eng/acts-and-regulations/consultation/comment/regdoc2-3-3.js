<h2>Preface</h2>  <p>This regulatory document is part of the CNSC&rsquo;s operating performance series of regulatory documents, which also covers commissioning, construction and severe accident management. The full list of regulatory document series is included at the end of this document and can also be found on the <a href="http://www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca/regulatory-documents">CNSC&#39;s Web site</a>.</p>   <p>Nuclear power plants in Canada are subject to the CNSC&rsquo;s ongoing regulatory oversight to ensure that the health, safety, security of Canadians and the environment are protected, and that Canada conforms to its international obligations regarding the peaceful use of nuclear energy.</p>  <p>To comply with the CNSC&rsquo;s regulatory requirements and their own internal governance, nuclear power plant (NPP) licensees conduct regular reviews of their performance to ensure safety is maintained. Licensees have also performed integrated safety reviews (ISRs) to assess the safety of their operations, facilities and equipment, prior to either a reactor refurbishment or the granting of a life extension to an existing plant. Combined with annual reporting on safety performance, ISRs aim to identify the necessary improvements to assure the continued safe operation of an NPP.</p>  <p>Regulatory document REGDOC-2.3.3, <em>Integrated Safety Reviews</em>, sets out the CNSC&rsquo;s requirements for the conduct of an ISR for an NPP. Following international practice, the CNSC is committed to introducing periodic ISRs for all NPPs. Guidance is also provided on how these requirements may be met. Conduct of an ISR will be a requirement for licence renewals. REGDOC-2.3.3 supersedes RD-360, <em>Life Extension of Nuclear Power Plants</em>, published in February 2008.</p>  <p>An ISR is a rigorous safety assessment that is complementary to &#8211 and does not replace &#8211; routine and non-routine regulatory reviews, inspections, mid-term reports, event reporting and investigations, or other CNSC compliance and verification activities.</p>  <p>The ISR involves an assessment of the current state of the plant and its performance to determine the extent to which it conforms to applicable regulatory requirements, and modern codes, standards and practices, and to identify any factors that would limit safe long-term operation. Operating experience in Canada and around the world, new knowledge from research and development activities, and advances in technology, are taken into account. This enables determination of reasonable and practical modifications that should be made to, structures, systems and components, and to existing programs, to ensure the safety of the facility to a level approaching that of modern nuclear power plants, and to ensure continued safe operation.</p>  <p>This document is intended to form part of the licensing basis for a regulated facility or activity within the scope of this document. It is intended for inclusion in licences, either as part of the conditions and safety and control measures in a licence, or as part of the safety and control measures to be described in a licence application and the documents needed to support that application.</p>  <p>Guidance contained in this document exists to inform the applicant, to elaborate further on requirements or to provide direction to licensees and applicants on how to meet requirements. It also provides more information about how CNSC staff evaluate specific problems or data during their review of licence applications. Licensees are expected to review and consider guidance; should they choose not to follow it, they should explain how their chosen alternate approach meets regulatory requirements.</p>  <p>For existing nuclear power plants, the requirements contained in this document do not apply unless they have been included, in whole or in part, in the licence or licensing basis.</p>  <p>An applicant or licensee may put forward a case to demonstrate that the intent of a requirement is addressed by other means and demonstrated with supportable evidence.</p>  <p>The requirements and guidance in this document are consistent with modern national and international practices addressing issues and elements that control and enhance nuclear safety. In particular, they establish a modern, risk-informed approach to the categorization of accidents &#8211; one that considers a full spectrum of possible events, including events of greatest consequence to the public.</p>

<h2 id="sec1" className="mrgn-tp-0">1. Introduction</h2>  <p>REGDOC-2.3.3, <em>Integrated Safety Reviews</em>, sets out the CNSC&rsquo;s requirements for the conduct of an integrated safety review (ISR). An ISR is a comprehensive evaluation of the design, condition and operation of a nuclear power plant (NPP, plant). It is an effective way to obtain an overall view of actual plant safety and the quality of the safety documentation, and to determine reasonable and practical modifications to ensure safety until the next ISR or, where appropriate, until the end of commercial operation.</p>  <p>Adopting periodic ISRs in support of licence renewal will ensure the continued improvement of NPP safety. Past experience with life-extension projects gives the CNSC and the Canadian nuclear industry a large degree of familiarity with the ISR process. As such, the periodic application of an ISR in Canada represents an evolution of a current practice, as opposed to the adoption of a new one.</p>

<h2 id="sec2" className="mrgn-tp-0">2. General Requirements</h2>  <p>The licensee shall conduct an ISR in accordance with this regulatory document for the period until the next ISR or, if applicable, until the end of commercial operation of the plant. The ISR shall be conducted according to the following four phases:</p>
<ol>
<li>preparation of an ISR basis document</li>
<li>conduct of the safety factors reviews and identification of findings</li>
<li>analysis of the findings and their integral impact on the NPP&rsquo;s safety (global assessment)</li>
<li>preparation of a plan of safety improvements (integrated implementation plan)</li>
</ol>
<h4>Guidance</h4>  <p>In accordance with IAEA SSG-25 and international practice, 10 years is considered an appropriate interval between ISRs to determine the extent to which the nuclear power plant conforms to applicable regulatory requirements, and modern codes, standards and practices, and to identify any factors that would limit its continued safe operation.</p>  <p>The complex process of conducting an ISR can be facilitated by subdividing it into tasks that are identified as safety factors. These safety factors are intended to cover all aspects that are important to the safety of an operating nuclear power plant.</p>  <p>The objectives of the ISR are to determine:</p>
<ol>
<li>the extent to which the facility conforms to applicable regulatory requirements and modern codes, standards and practices</li>
<li>the extent to which the licensing basis remains valid for the next licensing period</li>
<li>the adequacy and effectiveness of the arrangements and the structures, systems and components (SSCs) that are in place to ensure plant safety until the next ISR or where appropriate, until the end of commercial operation</li>
<li>the improvements to be implemented to resolve any findings identified in the review and timelines for their implementation</li>
</ol>  <p>The ISR is complementary to, and does not replace activities required and/or performed by the CNSC, including routine and non-routine regulatory reviews and inspections, mid-term reports, event reporting and investigations, or any other CNSC licensing and verification activities.</p>  <p>The ISR approach is outlined in IAEA Specific Safety Guide SSG-25, <em>Periodic Safety Review for Nuclear Power Plants</em> [1]. The terms &quot;safety factor&quot; and &quot;safety factor reports&quot; are an adoption of the IAEA SSG-25 terms, with the addition of a safety factor for radiation protection. Safety factor reports are discussed further in Sections 3 and 4.</p>   <p>In general, the licensee first prepares the ISR basis document which defines the scope and methodology for the ISR. This is then used to conduct the review, prepare the safety factor reports, and the global assessment report. The results of the ISR are used to establish the corrective actions and safety improvements to be included in the integrated implementation plan.</p>   <p>The documentation submitted to the CNSC includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>ISR basis document</li>
<li>reports on the review of each safety factor (safety factor reports)</li>
<li>Global assessment report (GAR)</li>
<li>Integrated implementation plan (IIP)</li>
</ol>  </p>

<ol>
<li>address all safety factors of the NPP including any interdependencies</li>
<li>identify all facilities and associated SSCs to be covered by the ISR</li>
<li>address unit-specific and site-specific issues</li>
<li>for multi-unit NPPs, address interdependencies on common SSCs not covered by item 1</li>
<li>consider all expected modes of operation; for a multi-unit facility, taking into consideration the operational state of each unit</li>
<li>include a comprehensive review of current licensing issues applicable to the safety factors</li>
</ol>  <h4>Guidance</h4>  <p>The scope of the ISR should include a review of each of the following safety factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>plant design</li>
<li>actual condition of SSCs important to safety</li>
<li>equipment qualification (environmental and seismic)</li>
<li>aging</li>
<li>deterministic safety analysis</li>
<li>probabilistic safety assessment</li>
<li>hazard analysis</li>
<li>safety performance</li>
<li>use of experience from other NPP and research findings</li>
<li>organization, the management system and safety culture</li>
<li>procedures</li>
<li>human factors</li>
<li>emergency planning</li>
<li>radiological impact on the environment</li>
<li>radiation protection</li>
</ol>  <p>SSG-25, <em>Periodic Safety Review of Nuclear Power Plants &#8211; Safety Guide</em>, [1] describes 14 safety factors that have been selected on the basis of international experience and are intended to cover all factors important to NPP safety. The scope, tasks and methodologies of these 14 safety factors are considered to meet the CNSC&rsquo;s expectations for corresponding safety factors 1-14 listed above. The CNSC has included an additional safety factor on radiation protection; the licensee should refer to the licence conditions handbook for the scope and tasks for the review of this safety factor. The ISR basis document should include, in the scope and tasks, how the intent of each task listed for a safety factor in SSG-25 will be addressed.</p>  <p>It is expected that the effort necessary to carry out a second (or subsequent) ISR of an NPP will often be considerably less than the first. In general, subsequent ISRs will focus on changes in requirements, facility conditions, operating experience and new information, rather than repeating the activities of previous reviews. However, while focusing on the changes, the subsequent ISR should consider explicitly whether the earlier ISR conclusions continue to remain valid (for example, in light of the time elapsed since it was performed).</p>

<li>conducting assessments against applicable regulatory requirements, and modern codes, standards and practices</li>
<li>conducting a global assessment of facility safety in view of all ISR findings</li>
<li>identifying any corrective actions and modifications that are necessary to address ISR findings to improve the level of safety</li>
</ol>  <h4>Guidance</h4>  <p>The methodologies that will be applied for the ISR should be described in the ISR basis document to show how the licensee plans to achieve the ISR objectives as stated in section 2. The methodologies outlined in SSG-25 [1] for performing safety factor reviews provide an acceptable approach.</p>  <p>Since processes and programs have many levels of interdependencies and interrelationships, the reviews should be conducted using internal documents that correctly represent these dependencies and relationships. To ensure this, a freeze date should be established for the internal documents used in the safety factor reviews. The reviews are then carried out using documents that are applicable to the document freeze date.</p>

<ol>
<li>the criteria for their selection</li>
<li>the ISR cut-off date beyond which changes to codes and standards and new information will not be considered</li>
<li>the type of review to be performed (clause-by-clause, high level or alternative)</li>
</ol>  <h4>Guidance</h4>  <p>An integral element of the ISR is the assessment of the conformance of the current NPP&rsquo;s state to requirements and expectations set out in CNSC regulatory requirements, and modern codes, standards and practices. A list of modern codes, standards and practices with their cut-off dates, should be established prior to any work being carried out. This ensures a common and consistent expectation for the reviews.</p>  <p>Modern codes, standards and practices should be selected taking into consideration the CNSC&rsquo;s regulatory framework, as well as modern international practices and operational experience. Primary consideration for selection of codes and standards should rest with those referenced in licences and CNSC regulatory documents. IAEA documents and other appropriate international standards should also be considered. If an appropriate Canadian code or standard is not available, the licensee should propose a reasonable substitute.</p>  <p>It is expected that all mandatory clauses in a code or standard will be reviewed to determine if the identified requirements are met. Any applicable sub-tier references in the mandatory clauses to other codes, standards and licensee documentation (for example, implementing procedures) should also be reviewed and addressed. A clause-by-clause type review should also be performed for new versions of codes and standards referenced by the licence and licence condition handbook. For other codes and standards, licensees may propose other types of reviews.</p>

<h3 id="sec3-6" className="mrgn-tp-0">3.6 Methodology for the identification, dispositioning and tracking of gaps</h3>  <p>The licensee shall describe the process and methodology for identifying, categorizing, prioritizing and dispositioning gaps. The licensee shall state what decision-making process will be used to evaluate and decide on the various alternatives to disposition the gaps.</p>   <p>The licensee shall confirm that any non-compliance with the current licensing basis will be addressed as quickly as practicable. To the extent practicable, the licensee shall also resolve identified gaps with respect to modern regulatory requirements, codes, standards and practices. The licensee shall track dispositioning and resolution of all gaps identified during the ISR through to their resolution.</p>  <h4>Guidance</h4>  <p>The ISR review should identify findings of the following types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>strengths</strong> &#8211; current practices are equivalent to or better than those established in modern codes and standards or industry practices</li>
<li><strong>gaps</strong> &#8211; current practices are not equivalent to those established in modern codes and standards or industry practices, or do not meet the current licensing basis, or are inconsistent with the operational documentation for plant</li>
</ul>  <p>The rationale behind identifying the findings and their disposition should be justified using valid arguments and supporting evidence. All gaps should be categorized and prioritized according to their safety significance. While assessing gaps for safety significance, the licensee should consider deterministic and probabilistic safety analyses, engineering judgment or a combination thereof. Suitability for assessment via selected means should be determined by the nature of the finding.</p>  <p>Depending on the nature of the findings, the licensee may also include considerations such as public radiation safety, plant operability, occupational radiation safety, emergency preparedness, and the environment when prioritizing gaps. The overall priority of a gap should inform the course of action to be taken to establish its recommended disposition. Any gaps representing the plant&rsquo;s non-compliance against the current licensing basis may be resolved through the existing plant programs. The licensee should establish and maintain a database of all gaps identified during the ISR.</p>

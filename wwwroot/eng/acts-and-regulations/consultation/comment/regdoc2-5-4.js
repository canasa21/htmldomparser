<h2>Preface</h2>  <p>This  regulatory document is part of the CNSC&rsquo;s Physical design series of regulatory  documents, which also covers design for reactor facilities, laboratories and  medical facilities. The full list of regulatory document series is included at  the end of this document and can also be found on the <a href="http://www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/acts-and-regulations/regulatory-documents/index">CNSC&rsquo;s website</a>.</p>  <p>REGDOC-2.5.4, <em>Design of Uranium Mines and Mills: Ventilation Systems</em>, is a guide  to help persons meet the requirements for submitting ventilation-related  information when applying for a CNSC licence to prepare a site for and  construct, operate or decommission a uranium mine or mill.</p>  <p>This document supersedes regulatory document G-221, <em>A Guide to Ventilation Requirements for  Uranium Mines and Mills</em>, published in June 2003.</p>  <p>REGDOC-2.5.4 is intended to form part of the safety  and control measures to be described in a licence application and the documents  needed to support that application.</p>  <p>Guidance contained in this document exists to inform  the applicant, to elaborate further on requirements or to provide direction to  licensees and applicants on how to meet requirements. It also provides more  information about how CNSC staff evaluate specific problems or data during  their review of licence applications. Licensees are expected to review and  consider guidance; should they choose not to follow it, they should explain how  their chosen alternate approach meets regulatory requirements.</p>  <p>A graded approach, commensurate with risk, may be  defined and used when applying the requirements and guidance contained in this  regulatory document. The use of a graded approach is not a relaxation of  requirements. With a graded approach, the application of requirements is  commensurate with the risks and particular characteristics of the facility or  activity.</p>  <p>An applicant or licensee may put forward a case to  demonstrate that the intent of a requirement is addressed by other means and  demonstrated with supportable evidence.</p>  <p>The requirements and guidance in this document are  consistent with modern national and international practices addressing issues  and elements that control and enhance nuclear safety. In particular, they  establish a modern, risk-informed approach to the categorization of accidents â€“  one that considers a full spectrum of possible events, including events of  greatest consequence to the public.</p>  <div className="alert alert-info">
<p><strong>Important  note:  </strong>Where referenced in a licence either directly or indirectly (such as through  licensee-referenced documents), this document is part of the licensing basis  for a regulated facility or activity.</p>
<p>The licensing basis sets the boundary conditions for  acceptable performance at a regulated facility or activity, and establishes the  basis for the CNSC&rsquo;s compliance program for that regulated facility or  activity.</p>
<p>Where this document is part of the licensing basis, the word  &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is used to express a requirement to be satisfied by the licensee or  licence applicant. &ldquo;Should&rdquo; is used to express guidance or that which is  advised. &ldquo;May&rdquo; is used to express an option or that which is advised or  permissible within the limits of this regulatory document. &ldquo;Can&rdquo; is used to  express possibility or capability.</p>
<p>Nothing contained in this document is to be construed as relieving  any licensee from any other pertinent requirements.

<h3 id="sec1-2">1.2 Scope</h3>  <p>REGDOC-2.5.4  is relevant to any application for a CNSC licence to prepare a site for and  construct, operate or decommission a uranium mine or mill. This guide  summarizes the ventilation-related obligations of uranium mine and mill  licensees, and also describes and discusses the ventilation-related information  that licence applicants should typically submit to meet regulatory  requirements.</p>  <p>The regulatory  document pertains to any ventilation of uranium mines and mills for the purpose  of assuring the radiation safety of workers and onsite personnel. This  ventilation may be associated with any underground or surface area or premise  that is licensable by the CNSC as part of a uranium mine or mill. These areas  and premises typically include mine workings, mill buildings, and other areas  or premises involving or potentially affected by radiation or radioactive  materials. Examples of the latter include offices, effluent treatment plants,  cafeterias, lunchrooms and personnel change rooms.</p>  <p>This  document may also assist in the design ventilation systems for deep geologic  repositories.</p>

Environmental Assessment and Licensing Processes</h2>  <p>The <em>Nuclear Safety and Control Act</em> obliges  the CNSC to determine, before issuing a licence, whether the applicant for the  licence is qualified and will make adequate provision for the health and safety  of persons, national security and protection of the environment and measures  required to implement Canada&rsquo;s international obligations. To make these  determinations, the CNSC needs credible and relevant information from  applicants.</p>

<h3 id="sec2-1">2.1	Environmental assessment process</h3>  <p>Upon  receipt of a licence application to prepare a site for and construct an uranium  mine and/or mill facility and a complete project description, the CNSC  determines whether the activity in the application requires an environmental  assessment (EA) pursuant to the <em>Canadian  Environmental Assessment Act, 2012</em> (CEAA 2012). The CEAA 2012 sets out the federal EA process in Canada; EAs under  the CEAA 2012 identify if a specific project is likely to cause significant  environmental effects, and determine whether those effects can be mitigated.

<h3 id="sec2-2">2.2	Licensing process</h3>  <p>The CNSC&rsquo;s  licensing process for uranium mines and mills follows the stages laid out in  the <em>Uranium Mines and Mills Regulations</em>,  proceeding progressively through site preparation and construction, operating,  decommissioning and abandonment phases. At each licensing stage, the CNSC  determines if the licence applicant is qualified and has made adequate  provision for the protection of the environment, the health and safety of  persons, and the maintenance of national security and measures required to  implement international obligations to which Canada has agreed. If satisfied,  the CNSC may issue a licence that contains appropriate conditions. </p>  <p>Typically,  a CNSC licence incorporates the applicant&rsquo;s commitments and any other  conditions that the CNSC considers necessary in the interests of health and  safety of persons, national security and protection of the environment.</p>  <p>The  information required by the CNSC at each licence application stage is  influenced by case-specific circumstances. Typically, the information supplied  at one stage serves as a building block for the next. An application for a CNSC  licence may include new information or, in accordance with section&nbsp;7 of  the <em>General Nuclear Safety and Control  Regulations</em>, it may incorporate by reference any information that is  contained in another CNSC-issued licence.

Overview of Ventilation Requirements in Legislation </h2>  <p>The <em>Uranium Mines and Mills Regulations</em> contain both direct and indirect references to the ventilation of uranium mines  or mills. Section 3 is a comprehensive summary of the general information to be  included in an application for a uranium mine or mill licence, except for a  licence to abandon. The section includes requirements that pertain exclusively  to the ventilation of uranium mines or mills, as well as others that encompass,  but are not limited to, ventilation-related matters. </p>  <p>Sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the <em>Uranium Mines and Mills Regulations</em> address ventilation systems and related matters, among other topics. These  subjects include:</p>  <ul>
<li>codes  of practice</li>
<li>design  of the mine or mill</li>
<li>results  of commissioning work</li>
<li>design  of equipment, systems and components</li>
<li>quality  assurance</li>
<li>commissioning  plans </li>
<li>operating,  maintenance and decommissioning policies, methods and procedures</li>  </ul>  <p>Section 10 pertains to both  ventilation-related and non-ventilation-related matters. It  requires uranium mine and mill licensees to: </p>  <ul>
<li>establish,  implement and maintain written operating procedures for their licensed  activities</li>
<li>train  their workers to perform work in accordance with operating procedures </li>
<li>audit  their workers for the purpose of verifying compliance with operating procedures </li>  </ul>  <p>Sections 11  and 12 specify the actions to be taken by CNSC licensees with respect to the  operation or malfunction of ventilation systems. <br />

<h2 id="sec4">4. Information Requirements at Prescribed Licensing Stages</h2>  <p>Radiation  safety in uranium mines and mills depends partly on the provision of adequate  ventilation in the workplace, and the ventilation-related requirements  discussed in this guide appear in the <em>Uranium  Mines and Mills Regulations</em> (UMMR). Historically, uranium mines and mills  have used active or passive ventilation measures to limit concentrations of  airborne radioactivity in workplaces. When properly designed, constructed,  monitored and maintained, such systems have proven to be practical and  effective in reducing radiation hazards.</p>  <p>Under the UMMR,  applicants for all classes of uranium mine and mill licences, except a licence  to abandon, are responsible for submitting prescribed information pertaining to  any proposed ventilation systems or activities. These information requirements  will vary with the licensing stage. For example, an application for a uranium  mine or mill operating licence should typically include a description of the  finalized proposal (i.e., the &ldquo;policies, methods and procedures&rdquo;) for operating  and maintaining any proposed ventilation system and &ldquo;as-built&rdquo; design details,  whereas more preliminary information on operating and maintenance policies,  methods and procedures might suffice at the siting and construction stage.  Conversely, proponents who plan to use unproven or novel technologies or  methods might need to provide more rigorous substantiations at an earlier  licensing stage than proponents of more conventional, proven approaches.</p>  <p>For uranium  mines and mills that fall under the <em>Nuclear  Safety and Control Act</em> (NSCA) and regulations, the ventilation-related  measures and activities proposed will depend partly on unique combinations of  legislated requirements and case-specific factors, at all stages of the  licensing process. These factors will reflect the options open to applicants or  proponents and their respective preferences, and include site, environmental  and technological constraints, such as ore-body characteristics, mining and  processing technologies, facility designs and operating methods.</p>  <p>In addition  to fulfilling regulatory requirements, proponents of uranium mine or mill  projects may be assigned additional undertakings to complete. Supplemental  work, or undertakings, can be identified through either the environmental  assessment review process or licensing hearings, or both. Undertakings and  conditions can be assigned by the CNSC or other government bodies from which  approvals are required.</p>  <p>At all  licensing stages, the CNSC will review any proposed ventilation systems or  activities against regulatory requirements, and will consider relevant  information that pertains directly or indirectly to the systems or activities. The  NSCA and regulations do not prescribe the form of applications for uranium mine  or mill licences, but state only the type of information that is to be  included. However, to aid regulatory review, the information contained in  licence applications should be organized and presented clearly and logically. </p>  <p>The  following sections summarize and discuss information requirements for uranium  mine and mill ventilation systems.</p>

<li>a  description of the planned state of the site upon completion of the  decommissioning work (subsection 7(d))</li>  </ul>  <h4>Guidance</h4>  <p>The information submitted in support of an application for a  licence to decommission should address the requirements listed above to a level  of detail and accuracy that demonstrates that the applicant has made adequate  allowance for the health and safety of persons, national security and  protection of the environment during decommissioning.</p>  <p>One example of making adequate allowance might be to provide  enhanced ventilation during some or all decommissioning activities. This could  involve the continued use, with or without modifications, of a ventilation  system that was used during the operating phase, or the use of new measures.  Accordingly, a licence applicant&rsquo;s preferred measures will typically be  influenced by case-specific circumstances, such as whether previously installed  ventilation systems have become radioactively contaminated during use, or  whether the proposed ventilation systems are likely to become similarly  contaminated upon use. To expedite regulatory review and licensing, the  application for a decommissioning licence should address any such  possibilities.</p>  <p>CNSC staff need to know the details of an applicant&rsquo;s proposed  decommissioning plans, so that it can evaluate the adequacy of any proposed use  or decommissioning of ventilation systems and equipment.</p>  <p>To help control radiation doses to workers and the public  during decommissioning activities, action levels that involve ventilation  activities or results can be incorporated into codes of practice at uranium  mines or mill.</p>

Operational and Maintenance-Related Requirements</h2>  <h4>Requirements</h4>  <p>If a code of practice is referred to in a uranium mine or  mill licence, the licensee is required by section 9 of the Uranium Mines and Mills Regulations (UMMR) to post a copy of the code of practice at a location within the uranium mine or  mill that is accessible to all workers  and where it is most likely to come to their attention.</p>  <p>Paragraph 10(a) of the UMMR obliges every CNSC licensee to  establish, implement and maintain written procedures for the conduct of  licensed activities. Accordingly, uranium mine and mill licensees that use  ventilation systems to help protect their workers and the public must  establish, implement and maintain written procedures to ensure that these  systems operate effectively. These operating procedures should include  provisions, such as inspection, surveillance or sampling programs, for purposes  of evaluating, controlling and demonstrating the effectiveness of the  associated systems.</p>  <p>Paragraph 10(b) of the UMMR further obliges licensees to  train their workers to perform work in accordance with operating procedures. To  meet this obligation as it relates to a ventilation system at a uranium mine or  mill, the licensee must ensure that the workers who are responsible for  following the ventilation-related operating procedures receive training to  perform their work.</p>  <p>Paragraph 10(c) of the UMMR also obliges licensees to audit  their workers for the purpose of verifying compliance with the relevant  operating procedures for the conduct of licensed activities, including those  for ventilation systems at uranium mines and mills.</p>  <p>Section 11 of the UMMR requires every licensee to: </p>  <ul>
<li>ensure  that each main fan of the ventilation systems established in accordance with  the licence is equipped with a device that provides a warning signal when the  main fan is not functioning properly (paragraph 11(a)) </li>
<li>ensure  that a person is designated to receive and respond to any warning signal  provided by the main-fan warning device (paragraph 11(b)) </li>
<li>implement  measures to prevent any person or activity from interfering with the proper  operation of the ventilation systems (paragraph 11(c))</li>  </ul>  <p>Where a ventilation system in a uranium mine or mill  workplace is not functioning in accordance with the licence, section 12 of the UMMR  requires the licensee to: </p>  <ul>
<li>implement  alternative measure to protect the health and safety of the workers (paragraph  12(1)(a)) </li>
<li>ensure  that only the work necessary to restore the ventilation system is performed in  the workplace (paragraph 12(1)(b))</li>  </ul>  <p>Subsection 12(2) of the UMMR stipulates that before a worker  performs any work that is necessary to restore a ventilation system at a  uranium mine or mill, the uranium mine or mill licensee shall inform the worker  of the protective measures that have been taken, and are to be taken in  connection with the work.</p>  <p>Section 16 of the UMMR requires  every uranium mine or mill licensee to keep the following records that pertain  to, or could pertain to, mine or mill ventilation systems:</p>  <ul>
<li>operating  and maintenance procedures (paragraph 16(1)(a))</li>
<li>the  design of the components and systems installed at the mine or mill (paragraph  16(1)(e))</li>
<li>the  method and relevant data used to ascertain the doses of radiation received by  workers at the uranium mine or mill and the intake of radioactive nuclear  substances by those workers (paragraph 16(1)(f)) </li>
<li>any  measurement made in accordance with the licence or the regulations made under  the Act (paragraph 16(1)(g)) </li>
<li>the  inspections and maintenance carried out in accordance with the licence or the  regulations made under the <em>Nuclear Safety  and Control Act</em> (paragraph 16(1)(h)) </li>

<h2>CNSC Regulatory Document Series</h2>
<p>Facilities and activities within the nuclear sector in Canada are regulated by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC). In addition to the <em>Nuclear Safety and Control Act </em>and associated regulations, these facilities and activities may also be required to comply with other&nbsp;regulatory instruments such as regulatory documents or standards.</p>
<p>Effective April 2013, the CNSC&#39;s catalogue of existing and planned regulatory documents has been organized under three key categories and twenty-five series, as set out below. Regulatory documents produced by the CNSC fall under one of the following series:</p>
<ul className="list-bullet-none">

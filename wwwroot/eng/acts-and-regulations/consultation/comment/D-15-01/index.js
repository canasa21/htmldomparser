</ul> </div>  <h2 id="exec-sum">Executive Summary</h2> <p>The Canadian Nuclear Safety  Commission (CNSC) regulates the use of nuclear energy and materials to protect  the health, safety and security of Canadians and the environment, and to  implement Canada&rsquo;s  international commitments on the peaceful use of nuclear energy. As part of  accomplishing this mandate, the CNSC controls the import and export of nuclear  and nuclear-related dual-use substances, equipment and technology under the <em>Nuclear Non-proliferation Import and Export  Control Regulations</em> (NNIECR). This discussion paper lays out proposed  amendments to the NNIECR, along with a related change in the <em>General Nuclear Safety and Control  Regulations</em> (GNSCR), in order to solicit comments from those potentially  impacted by the changes.</p> <p>In 2009, the <em>Nuclear Suppliers Group</em> (NSG) began an  extensive review of all entries in its Trigger List and Nuclear-related Dual-use  List. In June 2013, 53 changes to these lists were agreed to. The changes were  made to reflect developments in technology that increased, decreased or changed  the nature of the proliferation threat posed by the items. By common custom,  these revised lists were published by the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) in November 2013. With the publication of the revised lists, the CNSC  proposes to amend the corresponding entries in the NNIECR schedule to reflect  these changes. Canada&rsquo;s  trading partners within the NSG are also taking the appropriate steps to  reflect these changes in their national legislation.</p> <p>The CNSC is also proposing  several additional amendments to the NNIECR that would clarify schedule  entries, provide exemptions for items deemed to be of low proliferation risk,  provide for additional application information, and specify record-retention  requirements.</p> <p>This discussion paper  is intended to seek feedback from licensees, the Canadian public and other stakeholders  on these proposals to amend the NNIECR and GNSCR. The CNSC will consider all  feedback received during this consultation process. This pre-consultation  process will then feed into the formal consultation process during which the  proposed amendments will be published in the <em>Canada Gazette, Part I</em> for further public  comment.</p>
<h2 id="intro">1. Introduction</h2> <p>The Nuclear <em>Non-proliferation Import and Export Control Regulations</em> (NNIECR) provide for the regulatory control of imports and exports of nuclear  and nuclear-related dual-use substances, equipment and technology. These  controls assist the CNSC in implementing Canada&rsquo;s international and  bilateral commitments to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The NNIECR set out  regulatory requirements for the licensing of the import and export of items  deemed to be of proliferation significance. The schedule of items controlled  under the NNIECR is derived principally from lists agreed by the Nuclear  Suppliers Group (NSG), with some modifications to ensure that Canada&rsquo;s nuclear  non-proliferation policy is fulfilled.</p> <p>In 2009, the Participating  Governments of the NSG, of which Canada is an adherent, initiated a  comprehensive review of the export control list entries appearing in INFCIRC  254 Part 1 and Part 2, respectively known as the Trigger List and the  Nuclear-related Dual-use List. These are items of nuclear and nuclear-related  substances, equipment and technology (information) that are exported internationally  in accordance with supply guidelines agreed by the NSG. CNSC staff participated  in the review. The review led to 53 amendments to the control lists that were approved  by NSG Participating Governments in June 2013.</p> <p>The NSG Guidelines, including  control lists, are implemented by each Participating Government in accordance  with its national laws and practices. While the mechanisms vary, there is an  understanding that best efforts be made to effect implementation as soon as  practicable, in order to avoid discrepancies or differences among export  controls and possible proliferation risk. In Canada, implementation is done via  incorporation into the schedule of the <em>Nuclear  Non-proliferation Import and Export Control Regulations</em>, and into the <em>Export Control List</em> administered by the Department  of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development (DFATD).</p> <p>The CNSC proposes that the amendments  to the NSG control lists approved in June 2013 by NSG Participating  Governments, including Canada,  be incorporated into the NNIECR by amending these regulations. The CNSC is also  proposing additional changes to the NNIECR, along with a related change to the <em>General Nuclear Safety and Control  Regulations</em> (GNSCR), to clarify certain entries, reduce regulatory burden  for items deemed to be of low proliferation significance, and to provide  additional information for use in assessing applications and licensee compliance.  The proposed amendments are described within this document.</p> <p>In accordance with the Government  of Canada&rsquo;s Red Tape Reduction Action Plan announced in 2012, the CNSC is  interested in hearing from licensees about the impact of these proposals on  their cumulative levels of administrative burden. This information will be used  to analyze the impacts of the regulatory proposal on Canadian businesses.</p> <p>Activities that impose administrative  burden include planning, collecting, processing and reporting information,  completing forms and retaining data required by the federal government to  comply with a regulation. This includes filling out licence applications and  forms, as well as finding and compiling data for audits and routinely scheduled  reports submitted to the CNSC.</p> <p>In many cases, the proposals  contained in this discussion paper involve new definitions or clarifications for  which the CNSC does not anticipate any impact on the administrative burden  experienced by licensees. The CNSC encourages validation of these assumptions.</p> <p>The CNSC will never compromise  safety and the Government of Canada has said that the Red Tape Reduction Action  Plan must be implemented in a way that ensures protection of the public,  environment and economy is preserved. In this context, the CNSC is interested  in lessening administrative burden where possible. Feedback from stakeholders  on the impacts of proposals in this document and mechanisms to reduce  administrative burden is welcome.</p> <h2 id="sec-2">2. Description of Proposed Amendments</h2>
<p>As described above, the bulk of the  proposed amendments to the NNIECR are the result of changes to the Nuclear  Suppliers Group lists from which the NNIECR schedule is principally derived. These  changes are the outcome of a comprehensive review of the NSG Trigger List  (so-called because the export of nuclear items on the list triggers nuclear safeguards  considerations) and the Nuclear-related Dual-use list. The latter identifies  materials, equipment and technology that are widely used in non-nuclear  applications, but that may also be used in the production of weapons and  weapons-usable material, and are therefore subject to export control. These  proposed amendments to the NNIECR schedule, which are significant in number,  are described in tabular form in Appendix&nbsp;A.</p> <p>In addition to the NSG-related  changes, the CNSC is proposing several changes to address issues identified by  staff since the 2010 amendments to the NNIECR and a related change to the GNSCR.  These issues include:</p><ul>   <li>lack of NSG explanatory notes  in the schedule entries reduces clarity of the NNIECR</li>   <li>lack of clarity in certain schedule  entries and in an exemption found in Section 4 may cause licensee confusion and  unnecessary administrative burden </li>   <li>controls on certain items of  low proliferation significance may place an unnecessary burden on licensees</li>   <li>additional information in  licence applications is required to assist in assessing applications for  proliferation risk</li>   <li>lack of a requirement for  written compliance procedures hinders CNSC efforts to ensure that CNSC  licensees comply with CNSC licensing requirements</li>   <li>the requirement to present an  import or export licence to a Customs officer for prescribed information is not  always possible</li> </ul>
<p>The one-year default record  retention requirement found in the GNSCR is deemed insufficient to meet CNSC&rsquo;s  needs with respect to verification of compliance.</p> <p>Subsections 2.1-2.5 below outline  in detail the proposed amendments to the NNIECR and GNSCR which would address  these issues.</p> <h3 id="sec-2-1">2.1 Proposed corrections/clarifications to schedule entries</h3> <h4 id="sec-2-1-1">2.1.1 Addition of technical notes</h4> <p>The technical notes found in the  NSG control lists, currently not included in the NNIECR, will be added to the schedule  to assist in clarifying the applicability of the regulatory controls.</p> <h4 id="sec-2-1-2">2.1.2 Exemption for nuclear grade graphite</h4>  <p>Section 4(1)(f) currently has no  link between the exemption for exports of graphite and the related reporting  requirements found later in section 4(3), which has potential for licensee  confusion. &nbsp;The CNSC proposes to clarify  the exemption for exports of graphite and the related reporting requirements  found in section 4 of the NNIECR by adding a cross-reference in 4(1)(f) as  follows:</p> <ul className="list-bullet-none"> 	<li><em>(f)	export the controlled nuclear substance referred to in paragraph A.1.4 of the schedule that is not for use in a nuclear reactor to any Participating Government of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. Use of this exemption requires submission of Annual Reports as described in 4(3).</em></li> </ul>   <h4 id="sec-2-1-3">2.1.3 Description of technology</h4> <p>The CNSC proposes to clarify the description  of technology found in A.4.1 and B.3.1 to address intangible technology  transfer. This clarification would assist exporters in determining when they require  an export licence for a technology transfer. The new definition would read as  follows:</p> <ul className="list-bullet-none"> 	<li><em>Technical data for the design, production, construction, operation or maintenance of any item in this part, except data available to the public (e.g.in published books or periodicals, or that which has been made available without restrictions on its further dissemination), including, but not limited to, technical drawings, models, instructions (written or recorded), working knowledge, design drawings, models, technical and operational manuals, skills training and parts catalogues. NOTE (a) Technical data as described above is subject to control under both tangible and intangible modes of transfer.</em></li> </ul>
<h4 id="sec-2-1-4">2.1.4 Correction to vacuum pump entry</h4> <p>The CNSC proposes to correct an  error in the measurement of <em>torr</em> found in the vacuum pump entry B.2.2.11 where the measurement should be 10<sup>-4</sup>  instead of 10<sup>4</sup> Torr. The corrected entry would read as follows:</p> <ul className="list-bullet-none"> 	<li><em>Vacuum pumps with an input throat size of 38cm (15  in.) or greater with a pumping speed of 15,000 L/s or greater and capable of  producing an ultimate vacuum better than 10<sup>-4</sup>Torr (1.33x10<sup>-4</sup>mbar)</em></li> </ul> <h4 id="sec-2-1-5">2.1.5 Description of end-use controls</h4> <p>The CNSC proposes to clarify that  the end-use controls also apply to exports to unsafeguarded nuclear activities,  and to strengthen the existing end-use controls found in B.1.1.20 and B.2.7.6. The  revised entries would read as follows:</p> <ul className="list-bullet-none"> 	<li><em>Any substance [equipment] not otherwise included in  paragraph B.1[B.2] if the substance [equipment] is intended, or there are  reasonable grounds to suspect that it is intended, in whole or in part, for use  in connection with an unsafeguarded nuclear fuel cycle activity or the design,  development, production, handling, operation, maintenance, storage, detection,  identification or dissemination of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive  devices, or of materials or equipment that could be used in such weapons or  devices.</em></li> </ul> <h3 id="sec-2-2">2.2	Proposed exemptions to schedule entries</h3> <p>In order to reduce unnecessary regulatory burden on licensees, the CNSC proposes to provide exemptions for the following items deemed to be of low proliferation risk:</p> <ul> 	<li>The import or export of source  material (entry A.1.2(b)) used in civil non-nuclear applications such as  shielding, radiation devices, packaging, ballasts, counter-weights or the  production of alloys and ceramics.</li>
<li>The import or export of thorium (entry A.1.2(c)) used in civil non-nuclear applications, including thorium contained in lamps, lights, welding rods and engine coatings. This exemption would not apply to bulk imports or exports of thorium for the manufacture of these items.</li>
<li>The import of nuclear grade  graphite (A.1.4.) that is not for use in a nuclear reactor.</li>
<li>The import or export of tritium  (entry A.1.5) contained in signs, for illumination, which have been installed  in aircraft, ships or vehicles (conveyances); and tritium contained in watches,  compasses, musical instruments or used as biological tracers. This exemption would  not apply to bulk imports or exports of tritium for the manufacture of these  items.</li> </ul> <h3 id="sec-2-3">2.3	Proposed additional application information requirements</h3> <p>The CNSC proposes to add the  following items to section 3(1), the most significant of which would be a  requirement for an applicant to include their written compliance procedures in  an application for a licence to import or export:</p> <ul className="list-bullet-none"> 	<li><em>3(1)(a) The provision of  the applicant&rsquo;s Canada Revenue  Agency-assigned business number</em> in  addition to their name, address and telephone number;</li> </ul> <p>New entries as follows:</p> <ul> 	<li><em>3(1)(i) the name of the anticipated place of entry or exit</em></li>
<li><em>3(1)(j) the name(s) of any anticipated transit states</em></li>
<li><em>3(1)(k) the applicant&rsquo;s written procedures to ensure compliance with  import and export regulatory requirements, including those associated with the  allocation of management functions and responsibilities, internal tracking and  compliance verification procedures, internal audit procedures, staff training  programs and record management procedures</em></li> </ul> <p>With regard to the addition of 3(1)(k),  the intention is that applicants shall have in place written procedures to  ensure compliance with import and export controls under the NSCA. The first  application for a licence to import or export should contain a copy of the  compliance procedures referenced in the proposed 3(k). These procedures will be  assessed as part of the licence application and, if they meet the requirements,  the licensee will be notified as such in the cover letter to the relevant  licence. For subsequent applications &ndash; assuming there are no extenuating  circumstances &ndash; the licensee will only need to make reference to the previously  submitted procedures.</p> <h3 id="sec-2-4">2.4	Proposed record retention requirement</h3> <p>The  CNSC proposes to add a requirement which would specify a six year record  retention period versus the GNSCR default of one year. This would be specified as  follows:</p> <p>Records  to be kept and retained</p> <ul className="list-bullet-none"> 	<li><em>Every licensee shall keep, for a period of six years  after the date of import or export pursuant to these Regulations, all records relevant  to any import or export pursuant to a CNSC licence, including (i) the  application and supporting information submitted to the CNSC (ii) the licence;  (iii) the Customs Declaration and associated documentation submitted at the  time of import or export; (iv) shipping manifests and associated documentation;  (v) any purchase order or certification of manufacture; and, (vi) notification  and other reporting submissions made pursuant to licence conditions.</em></li> </ul> <h3 id="sec-2-5">2.5	Proposed amendment to the General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations</h3> <p>In response to licensee concerns  raised over the past few years on the practical constraint on the ability of a  licensee to comply with Section 18 of the GNSCR when importing or exporting  prescribed information through intangible means (e.g., downloads, e-mail), the  CNSC proposes to remove the requirement to present an import or export licence  to a Customs officer for prescribed information. The revised entry would delete  the term &lsquo;prescribed information&rsquo; and read as follows:</p> <ul className="list-bullet-none"> 	<li><em>18. On importing or exporting a nuclear substance or  prescribed equipment, the licensee shall present the required import or export  licence to a customs officer.</em></li> </ul> <h2 id="sec-3">3. Conclusion</h2> <p>The proposed amendments would  ensure that the CNSC&rsquo;s regulations remain up-to-date and ensure a level  playing-field for industry within the Participating Governments of the Nuclear  Suppliers Group. Further, these amendments would ensure that Canada is able  to fulfill its international commitments in the area of non-proliferation while  reducing unnecessary burden on industry by controlling only those items which  are deemed to pose the greatest proliferation risk.</p> <p>In addition, several of the  proposed amendments would provide relief for Canadian importers and exporters  dealing in items with very low proliferation significance by providing a  licensing exemption for those items. Similarly, the clarifications provided for  other existing entries should reduce industry administrative burden and  increase efficiency by reducing the number of requests for clarification and  submission of unnecessary applications.</p> <p>While the proposed amendments do include  new requirements, they require the provision of information and documents  readily available for most importers and exporters. The requirement to provide  information on compliance procedures formalizes existing CNSC expectations of  licensee compliance and, in most cases, will entail a one-time submission with  an initial application. Finally, the proposal to require applicants to provide  additional information at the time of application on business number, transit  states, and port of entry/exit is assessed not to add any significant burden in  the application process, and will serve to facilitate more timely completion of  risk assessments.</p> <h2 id="sec-4">4. Public Input</h2>  <p>The CNSC welcomes feedback on the  proposed changes to the NNIECR as outlined in this discussion paper.</p> <p>In addition to feedback on proposed  changes, the CNSC would also appreciate receiving the following information  from licensees, which will aid in the calculation of the cumulative costs or  savings of any administrative burden change:</p>
<ul> 	<li>How many employees in your  business would be subject to a change in administrative activities resulting  from this proposal? What are the generic position titles of those employees?  (e.g. technician, manager, clerk, etc.)</li>
<li>How many hours would it take  those employees to perform any new administrative tasks over a 1-year period? </li>   <li>How many hours would be saved  through licensing exemptions or clarifications?</li>
<li>What is the approximate salary  cost per hour?</li>
<li>Do you have any suggestions on  how these costs could be reduced, while continuing to fulfil the objective of  the proposal and without compromising safety?</li>  </ul> <p>The CNSC expects that this proposal will result in minimal overall change to current level of administrative burden experienced by licensees.</p> <p> The CNSC will use this input in preparing regulatory amendments for pre-publication in the <em>Canada Gazette, Part I</em>. After due process, the amendments would proceed to publication in <em>Canada Gazette, Part II</em> and then, with the approval of the Governor in Council, the amendments would enter into force.</p>

<td><p>INTRODUCTORY NOTE <br/> <p>Reprocessing irradiated nuclear fuel  separates plutonium and uranium from intensely radioactive fission products and  other transuranic elements. Different technical processes can accomplish this separation.  However, over the years Purex has become the most commonly used and accepted  process. Purex involves the dissolution of irradiated nuclear fuel in nitric  acid, followed by separation of the uranium, plutonium, and fission products by  solvent extraction using a mixture of tributyl phosphate in an organic diluent.</p> <p>Purex facilities have process functions  similar to each other, including: irradiated fuel element chopping, fuel  dissolution, solvent extraction, and process liquor storage. There may also be  equipment for thermal denitration of uranium nitrate, conversion of plutonium  nitrate to oxide or metal, and treatment of fission product waste liquor to a  form suitable for long term storage or disposal. However, the specific type and  configuration of the equipment performing these functions may differ between  Purex facilities for several reasons, including the type and quantity of  irradiated nuclear fuel to be reprocessed and the intended disposition of the  recovered materials, and the safety and maintenance philosophy incorporated  into the design of the facility.</p> <p>A &ldquo;plant for the reprocessing of  irradiated fuel elements&rdquo;, includes the equipment and components which normally  come in direct contact with and directly control the irradiated fuel and the  major nuclear material and fission product processing streams.</p> <p>These processes, including the complete systems  for plutonium conversion and plutonium metal production, may be identified by  the measures taken to avoid criticality (e.g. by geometry), radiation exposure  (e.g. by shielding), and toxicity hazards (e.g. by containment).</p></td>

In order to  achieve high speed the materials of construction for the rotating components  have to be of a high strength to density ratio and the rotor assembly, and  hence its individual components, have to be manufactured to very close  tolerances in order to minimize the unbalance. In contrast to other  centrifuges, the gas centrifuge for uranium enrichment is characterized by  having within the rotor chamber a rotating disc-shaped baffle(s) and a  stationary tube arrangement for feeding and extracting the UF<sub>6</sub> gas  and featuring at least three separate channels, of which two are connected to  scoops extending from the rotor axis towards the periphery of the rotor  chamber. Also contained within the vacuum environment are a number of critical  items which do not rotate and which although they are especially designed are  not difficult to fabricate nor are they fabricated out of unique materials. A  centrifuge facility however requires a large number of these components, so  that quantities can provide an important indication of end use.</p></td>

<td><p>INTRODUCTORY NOTE<br/> The slight difference in mass between  the isotopes of uranium causes small changes in chemical reaction equilibria  that can be used as a basis for separation of the isotopes. Two processes have  been successfully developed: liquid-liquid chemical exchange and solid-liquid  ion exchange. </p> <p>In the liquid-liquid chemical exchange  process, immiscible liquid phases (aqueous and organic) are countercurrently  contacted to give the cascading effect of thousands of separation stages. The  aqueous phase consists of uranium chloride in hydrochloric acid solution; the organic  phase consists of an extractant containing uranium chloride in an organic  solvent. The contactors employed in the separation cascade can be liquid-liquid  exchange columns (such as pulsed columns with sieve plates) or liquid  centrifugal contactors. Chemical conversions (oxidation and reduction) are  required at both ends of the separation cascade in order to provide for the  reflux requirements at each end. A major design concern is to avoid  contamination of the process streams with certain metal ions. Plastic,  plastic-lined (including use of fluorocarbon polymers) and/or glass-lined  columns and piping are therefore used.</p> <p>In the solid-liquid  ion-exchange process, enrichment is accomplished by uranium  adsorption/desorption on a special, very fast-acting, ion-exchange resin or  adsorbent. A solution of uranium in hydrochloric acid and other chemical agents  is passed through cylindrical enrichment columns containing packed beds of the  adsorbent. For a continuous process, a reflux system is necessary to release  the uranium from the adsorbent back into the liquid flow so that &lsquo;product&rsquo; and  &lsquo;tails&rsquo; can be collected. This is accomplished with the use of suitable  reduction/oxidation chemical agents that are fully regenerated in separate  external circuits and that may be partially regenerated within the isotopic  separation columns themselves. The presence of hot concentrated hydrochloric  acid solutions in the process requires that the equipment be made of or  protected by special corrosion-resistant materials.</p></td>

<td><p>INTRODUCTORY NOTE<br/> Heavy water can be produced by a variety  of processes. However, the two processes that have proven to be commercially  viable are the water-hydrogen sulphide exchange process (GS process) and the  ammonia-hydrogen exchange process.</p> <p>The GS process is based upon the exchange  of hydrogen and deuterium between water and hydrogen sulphide within a series  of towers which are operated with the top section cold and the bottom section  hot. Water flows down the towers while the hydrogen sulphide gas circulates  from the bottom to the top of the towers. A series of perforated trays are used  to promote mixing between the gas and the water. Deuterium migrates to the  water at low temperatures and to the hydrogen sulphide at high temperatures.  Gas or water, enriched in deuterium, is removed from the first stage towers at  the junction of the hot and cold sections and the process is repeated in  subsequent stage towers. The product of the last stage, water enriched up to  30% in deuterium, is sent to a distillation unit to produce reactor grade heavy  water; i.e., 99.75% deuterium oxide. </p> <p>The ammonia-hydrogen exchange process  can extract deuterium from synthesis gas through contact with liquid ammonia in  the presence of a catalyst. The synthesis gas is fed into exchange towers and  to an ammonia converter. Inside the towers the gas flows from the bottom to the  top while the liquid ammonia flows from the top to the bottom. The deuterium is  stripped from the hydrogen in the synthesis gas and concentrated in the  ammonia. The ammonia then flows into an ammonia cracker at the bottom of the  tower while the gas flows into an ammonia converter at the top. Further  enrichment takes place in subsequent stages and reactor grade heavy water is  produced through final distillation. The synthesis gas feed can be provided by  an ammonia plant that, in turn, can be constructed in association with a heavy  water ammonia-hydrogen exchange plant. The ammonia-hydrogen exchange process  can also use ordinary water as a feed source of deuterium.</p> <p>Many of the key equipment items for  heavy water production plants using GS or the ammonia-hydrogen exchange  processes are common to several segments of the chemical and petroleum  industries. This is particularly so for small plants using the GS process.  However, few of the items are available &ldquo;off-the-shelf&rdquo;. The GS and  ammonia-hydrogen processes require the handling of large quantities of  flammable, corrosive and toxic fluids at elevated pressures. Accordingly, in  establishing the design and operating standards for plants and equipment using  these processes, careful attention to the materials selection and  specifications is required to ensure long service life with high safety and  reliability factors. The choice of scale is primarily a function of economics  and need. Thus, most of the equipment items would be prepared according to the  requirements of the customer.</p> <p>Finally, it should be noted that, in  both the GS and the ammonia-hydrogen exchange processes, items of equipment  which individually are not especially designed or prepared for heavy water  production can be assembled into systems which are especially designed or  prepared for producing heavy water. The catalyst production system used in the  ammonia-hydrogen exchange process and water distillation systems used for the  final concentration of heavy water to reactor-grade in either process are  examples of such systems.</p> <p>The items of equipment which are especially  designed or prepared for the production of heavy water utilizing either the  water-hydrogen sulphide exchange process or the ammonia-hydrogen exchange  process include those found in A.2.5.1 to A.2.5.9.</p></td>

In a scroll compressor or  vacuum pump, crescent-shaped pockets of gas are trapped between one or more  pairs of intermeshed spiral vanes, or scrolls, one of which moves while the  other remains stationary. The moving scroll orbits the stationary scroll; it  does not rotate. As the moving scroll orbits the stationary scroll, the gas  pockets diminish in size (i.e., they are compressed) as they move toward the  outlet port of the machine.</em></p> <p><em>2. In a bellows-sealed scroll  compressor or vacuum pump, the process gas is totally isolated from the  lubricated parts of the pump and from the external atmosphere by a metal  bellows. One end of the bellows is attached to the moving scroll and the other  end is attached to the stationary housing of the pump.</em></p> <p><em>3.

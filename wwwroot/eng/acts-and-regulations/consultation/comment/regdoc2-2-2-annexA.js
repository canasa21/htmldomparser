<h2>ANNEX A</h2>  <h3>Additional Guidance for Using REGDOC-2.2.2 to Develop Radiation Safety Training Programs for Workers Involved In Licensed Activities with Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices, and With Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment</h3>  <p>An effective radiation safety training program is essential to protecting health, safety, security and the environment, and is considered part of a comprehensive occupational health and safety program.</p>  <p>This Annex provides additional guidance on the implementation of the requirements of REGDOC-2.2.2, Personnel Training. The high-level process diagram presented on the following page and the subsequent supporting descriptions provide guidance regarding how SAT-based processes and procedures could be applied for developing radiation safety training programs.</p>  <p>Licensees with relatively few worker categories performing relatively few or straightforward tasks may determine that a simplified training program is adequate to meet the needs of their workers. The CNSC requires that each of the process steps be included to the appropriate degree in developing even the simplest radiation safety training program.</p>  <p>The topics to be covered by a training program, and the depth to which they should be addressed, will depend on the complexity of the licensed activity, the specific duties of workers, the radiological risk associated with those duties, and previous training and experience.</p>

<tr>
<th scope="row">Step 1:<br/>
Analysis Phase*<br/>
(Section 5.1 of REGDOC 2.2.2)</th>
<td className="">Identify jobs with potential radiological risk. Is there a training need?</td>
<td className="">Define worker categories and worker characteristics involved with the identified jobs.</td>
<td className="">For each identified job, create a task list.</td>
<td className="">Identify the knowledge, skills and safety related attributes associated with each task.</td>
<td className="">Objectively determine how Difficult, the Importance to safety and how Frequent the tasks are performed. (DIF)</td>
<td className="">Based on DIF of each task, determine whether training will be initial or initial and continuing. If continuing training is deemed appropriate assign a frequency. (ex: every year)</td>
<td className="">Link each task to appropriate training references and define exactly, what, when and how the trainee should be able to perform the task at the conclusion of training. (Terminal Learning Objectives &ndash; TLOs)</td>

<td className="">Define and document test items for assessment of workers.</td>
<td className="">Determine if testing/ assessment will be written, practical or a combination.</td>

Development Phase<br/>
(Section 5.3 of REGDOC 2.2.2)</th>
<td className="">Create lesson plans for each topic. Review existing training material to determine suitability.</td>
<td className="">Create a training manual for trainees. (if applicable)</td>
<td className="">Create formal assessment material linked to TLOs/ exams. (written, oral or on-the-job)</td>
<td className="">Create a feedback form to be completed by workers once training is complete.</td>

Implementation Phase<br/>
(Section 5.4 of REGDOC 2.2.2)</th>

<td className="">Conduct formal assessments (written, oral or on-the-job)</td>
<td className="">Grade</td>

Evaluation Phase<br/>
(Section 5.5 of REGDOC 2.2.2)</th>

<li>The Licensee identifies two positions within its organization that are responsible for conducting radiation surveys using a survey meter.</li>
<li> The Licensee conducts a job and task analysis, ranks Difficulty, Importance snd Frequency (DIF) of each task numerically (in this case on a scale of 1-5) and produces associated table(below) which includes training decisions and links to specific training references.</li>
<li> Following formal review and approval of the analysis, the licensee proceeds to complete the remaining SAT phases detailed on the previous page.</li>

The operations should describe the fundamental steps needed to ensure that the package is properly prepared for transport, consistent with the package evaluation in Sections 2-6 of the application. The regulatory requirements for package operations are 10 CFR 71.87 and Paragraph&nbsp;502 of TS-R-1 as referenced in Subsection 16(4) of the PTNS Regulations.</p>  <p>The package should be operated in accordance with detailed written procedures that are based on and consistent with the operations described in this section of the application. The package operations should be consistent with maintaining occupational radiation exposures as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) as required by the <em>Standards for Protection Against Radiation</em> in 10 CFR 20.1101(b) or Paragraph&nbsp;302 of TS-R-1.</p>  <p>The package operations presented in the application should not be expected to be detailed procedures that could be implemented without expansion. Rather, the package operations should be an outline that focuses upon those steps that are important to assuring that the package is operated in a manner consistent with its evaluation for approval. Compliance with the submitted package operations will be included in the certificate by reference as a condition of approval. Procedural details that are not important to safety should not be included in the application. Operational steps should normally be presented in sequential order, as applicable. Guidance on preparing both the detailed procedures and the package operations included with an application can be found in NUREG/CR-4775 <em>Guide for Preparing Operating Procedures for Shipping Packages </em>[24].</p>

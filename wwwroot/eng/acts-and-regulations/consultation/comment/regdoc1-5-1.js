<h3 id="sec2-1">2.1 General</h3>  <p>Paragraph 21(1)(h) of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-28.3/index.html">NSCA</a> empowers the CNSC to certify prescribed equipment. The <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2000-205/page-1.html"><em>Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment Regulations</em></a> and the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2000-207/page-1.html"><em>Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices Regulations</em></a> stipulate application requirements for the certification of prescribed equipment. For the purpose of this document, prescribed equipment is limited to Radiation Devices under the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2000-207/page-1.html"><em>Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices Regulations</em></a> and Class II prescribed equipment under the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2000-205/page-1.html"><em>Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment Regulations</em></a>.</p>  <p>This certification is not to be construed as a licence for use, servicing or installation. Prescribed equipment must be certified by the CNSC before it can be used in Canada.</p>  <p>An application for certification needs to be submitted to the CNSC in order for a certificate to be issued. Applicants for certificates should complete the <a href="http://www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca/images/regulatory-documents/regdoc-1-5-1/Application-form-for-certification-of-radiation-devices-or-Class-II-prescribed-equipment-eng.pdf">application form for certification of radiation devices or Class II prescribed equipment</a> (see appendix A). Upon receipt, the CNSC reviews the submission to determine if:</p>
<ul>
<li>the prescribed equipment is safe to use</li>
<li>adequate measures are in place to protect the environment, the health and safety and security of persons, and national security</li>
<li>the design meets Canada&#39;s international obligations</li>
</ul>  <p>If satisfied that the design meets the above requirements, the CNSC or a designated officer may issue a certificate for the prescribed equipment. The certificate will incorporate a description of the prescribed equipment. The required fee is applied as described in the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2003-212/page-1.html"><em>Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission Cost Recovery Fees Regulations</em></a>.</p>  <p>Once a certificate has been issued, it applies to a specific model design and to specific operating conditions only.</p>

<div id="2.4"></div>
<h3 id="sec2-4">2.4 Certificate duration and recertification</h3>  <p>Certificates are issued for a limited duration, usually 15 years for radiation devices and 25 years for Class II prescribed equipment. This is to ensure that prescribed equipment is still supported by the manufacturer and, if still in production, is manufactured to the same standards as were used at the time of the original certification. In the case where the prescribed equipment is no longer supported by the manufacturer, a certificate may be issued, but the duration may be shorter.</p>  <p>To obtain certification following the expiration of a prescribed equipment certificate, the applicant (typically the manufacturer, although another entity may also apply for certification) should submit a new application. Where information has not changed from the original certification, a simple reference to the information originally submitted should clearly identify the specific document(s) involved. If the certification request is being made by an organization other than the original manufacturer, justification must be provided on how the original standards and designs are being maintained.</p>

<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>This regulatory document&nbsp;is part of the CNSC&#8217;s Human Performance Management series of regulatory documents, which also covers personnel training and fitness for duty. The full&nbsp;list of regulatory document series&nbsp;is included in the back of this document and can be found on the <a href="/eng/acts-and-regulations/index">CNSC&#8217;s Web site</a>.</p>
<p>Regulatory document REGDOC-2.2.3, <em>Personnel Certification: Radiation Safety Officers</em> sets out guidance to assist applicants in completing an application for certification as a Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) pursuant to the <em>Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment Regulations</em>.</p>
<p>This document is based on the <em>Nuclear Safety and Control Act</em> (NSCA) and its regulations, which are administered by the CNSC. The document provides detailed information about the completion of an application and the process for the RSO certification. The document explains what is needed in an application form, in order to assess if the applicant has the qualifications necessary to be certified as a RSO. The information submitted will also help the CNSC plan and conduct the certification examination. Any information which is submitted may subsequently be referred to in the RSO certificate. It then becomes a requirement of the certificate, and is thus legally binding.</p>
<p>While the use of the application form is not a specific requirement for certification, it is intended to assist applicants in submitting complete and structured information to the CNSC, so that the request can be processed as quickly as possible. The application form is available at
<a href="/">nuclearsafety.gc.ca</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="P95_3612" id="P95_3612"></a>1.0 Introduction </h2>
<h3><a name="P96_3628" id="P96_3628"></a>1.1 Purpose </h3>
<p>This regulatory document provides information to assist applicants in preparing and submitting applications for certification as a Radiation Safety Officer (RSO). Its purpose is to ensure that persons seeking certification by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) for the position of RSO at a Class II nuclear facility are qualified to carry out the duties of the position, in accordance with the <em>Nuclear Safety and Control Act </em>(NSCA) and its regulations. </p>
<p>The document also presents information related to the process that candidates seeking certification must undergo, in order to acquire and maintain the certification.</p>
<h3><a name="P99_4269" id="P99_4269"></a>1.2 Scope</h3>
<p>This document applies to any person applying for&#8212;or holding&#8212;a certificate for a Radiation Safety Officer pursuant to the <em>Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment Regulations</em>.</p>
<h3><a name="P101_4468" id="P101_4468"></a>1.3 Exemptions from certification</h3>
<p>This document does not apply to any Class II nuclear facility for which the RSO or equivalent is already certified under subsection 9(2) of the <em>Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations</em>.</p>
<h3><a name="P103_4684" id="P103_4684"></a>1.4 Relevant legislation</h3>
<p>The provisions of the NSCA and its regulations relevant to this document include:</p>
<ol>
<li> Paragraph 21(1)(i) of the NSCA empowers the Commission to certify and decertify persons referred to in paragraph 44(1)(k) of the NSCA as qualified to carry out their duties.</li>
<li> Paragraph 44(1)(k) of the NSCA empowers the Commission to make regulations respecting the qualifications for&#8212;and the training and examination of&#8212;nuclear energy workers and other persons employed in a nuclear facility.</li>
<li> Paragraph 37(2)(b) of the NSCA states that the Commission may authorize a designated officer to certify and decertify persons referred to in paragraph 44(1)(k) of the NSCA as qualified to carry out their duties.</li>
<li> Paragraph 12(1)(a) of the <em>General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations</em> <em>(</em>GNSCR) obliges every licensee to &#8220;ensure the presence of a sufficient number of qualified workers to carry on the licensed activity safely and in accordance with the Act, the regulations made under the Act and the licence.&#8221;</li>
<li> Paragraph 12(1)(b) of the GNSCR<em> </em>obliges every licensee to &#8220;train the workers to carry on the licensed activity in accordance with the Act, the regulations made under the Act and the licence.&#8221;</li>
<li> Paragraph 15(b) of the GNSCR<em> </em>obliges every licensee to notify the Commission of &#8220;the names and position titles of the persons who are responsible for the management and control of the licensed activity and the nuclear substances, nuclear facility, prescribed equipment or prescribed information encompassed by the licence.&#8221;</li>
<li> Section 15.01 of the <em>Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment Regulations</em> obliges every licensee to appoint a Radiation Safety Officer.</li>

</ol>
<a name="2.0"></a>
<h2><a name="P114_6826" id="P114_6826"></a>2.0 Radiation Safety Officer</h2>
<p>Pursuant to the <em>Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment Regulations, </em>all licensees who operate Class II nuclear facilities or who service Class II prescribed equipment are required to appoint a Radiation Safety Officer (RSO). The person occupying the position of RSO has several responsibilities, mainly ensuring that all CNSC requirements are followed whenever the activities authorized under the organization&#8217;s licence are performed. RSO&#8217;s responsibilities may include:</p>
<ol>
<li> ensuring the health and safety of personnel, the public and the environment </li>
<li> managing the daily aspects of the Radiation Protection Program</li>
<li> acting as the primary contact with the CNSC for licensing and compliance matters</li>
<li> identifying radiation safety problems</li>
<li> implementing corrective actions</li>
<li> ensuring compliance with the CNSC regulatory requirements</li>
<li> reporting regulatory non-compliances to the CNSC</li>
<li> holding the authority to stop any activity that might result in a regulatory non compliance</li>
<li>developing procedures and policies related to radiation safety and training</li>
<li> acting as the signing authority for CNSC licences</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="P126_7978" id="P126_7978"></a>2.1 Responsibility of the RSO and delegation of tasks</h3>
<p>An RSO is the person designated by the licensee as being responsible for the management and control of radiation safety for the licensed activity. An RSO may delegate some responsibilities or tasks to an assistant with the appropriate qualifications to carry out the assigned duties; however, the oversight of the radiation safety program remains with the certified RSO. As such, it is the RSO who is accountable to the licensee, and it is the licensee who is accountable to the CNSC for the appropriate safety and proper execution of duties within the Radiation Protection Program.</p>
<a name="3.0"></a>
<h2><a name="P128_8613" id="P128_8613"></a>3.0 Requirement for Certification </h2>
<p>All licensees who operate Class II facilities or service Class II prescribed equipment must have a certified RSO or a qualified temporary replacement. At a minimum, Class II licensees must have one certified RSO; however, depending on the organizational structure there may be several positions that are eligible to undergo certification.</p>
<h3><a name="P130_8984" id="P130_8984"></a>3.1 Different types of licensed activities at a given site</h3>
<p>A licensee&#8217;s site may contain several different types of licensed activities. Given that an RSO certificate specifies the type of licensed activity for which the person is certified, it is possible to have several RSOs at a given site, each one certified for a different type of licensed activity.</p>
<p>For example, a site with linear accelerators and a cyclotron may have a certified RSO for the linear accelerator facilities, and a different certified RSO for the cyclotron facility.</p>
<h3><a name="P133_9523" id="P133_9523"></a>3.2 Multiple RSOs</h3>
<h4>Assistant or deputy RSOs</h4>
<p>If a licensee has an assistant or deputy RSO, these positions may also be eligible for certification if the assistant is regularly undertaking tasks similar to that of an RSO. It is therefore possible to have more than one certified person per licensee or licensed activity, though it is not a regulatory requirement to have assistants certified.</p>
<h4>Provincial or Corporate RSO</h4>
<p>Corporate, provincial or other higher level RSO positions do not require certification if they are not at the site of the licensed activity on a daily basis and not involved in the day-to-day operation of the facility.</p>
<h3><a name="P138_10155" id="P138_10155"></a>3.3 Physical presence of RSOs </h3>
<p>While there is no specific regulatory requirement to have a certified RSO onsite on a day-to-day basis, aside from the two scenarios described below, the RSO would not normally be capable of performing the duties of the position as required in section 15.04(b) of the regulations if they were not onsite at the time of licensed activity and therefore there should be, at a minimum, one certified RSO working at the site of the licensed activity on a day-to-day basis.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>3.3.1 Offsite facilities and close proximity locations</h4>
<p>In some cases, a facility may be installed at a satellite location nearby, but is part of the same organizational structure as the main facility. In other instances, the licensee&#8217;s operations may be spread over multiple locations within close proximity in one city, but again, all locations are under the same organizational structure. In such cases it may not be necessary to have one certified RSO per site if:</p>
<ol>
<li> the RSO is easily capable of accessing all locations on a day-to-day basis</li>
<li> the RSO routinely visits each site as part of the RSO&#8217;s normal duties</li>
</ol>
<p>The licensee should contact the CNSC if this situation applies.</p>
<h4>3.3.2 Third-party servicing licensees</h4>
<p>Organizations holding a third-party Class II servicing licence may have only one RSO whom is responsible for a given licensed activity, but not necessarily present at each location where the  licensed activity is performed.</p>
<a name="4.0"></a>
<h2><a name="P148_11596" id="P148_11596"></a>4.0 Certification Process</h2>
<h3><a name="P149_11620" id="P149_11620"></a>4.1 General </h3>
<p>The <em>Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment Regulations</em> requires that every candidate be certified by the CNSC before being appointed as RSO.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the licensee to identify a candidate to be appointed as RSO, and contact the CNSC to initiate the process for certification.</p>
<p>There are two components to the certification process: </p>
<ol>
<li> assessment of the candidate&#8217;s capabilities to perform the duties of the position, based on the submitted application </li>
<li>assessment of the candidate&#8217;s knowledge, based on an examination</li>
</ol>
<p>The process is initiated by the CNSC upon receipt of a complete application from the licensee.   Upon review of the application, if an assessment of the material provided indicates that the candidate appears to be capable of performing the duties of the position, CNSC staff will contact the candidate to schedule a certification examination.</p>
<p>If the candidate is able to clearly demonstrate his or her knowledge (see section 4.3, below) as it relates to the position of RSO within their organization, the CNSC will issue a certificate for the individual, detailing the location, organization and types of facilities for which the person is certified to serve as RSO.</p>
<h3><a name="P157_12849" id="P157_12849"></a>4.2 Submission of application</h3>
<p>Submit a signed and dated application and supporting documentation to the CNSC at:</p>
<p>Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission<br />
Directorate of Nuclear Substance Regulation<br />
P.O. Box 1046, Station B<br />
280 Slater Street<br />
Ottawa, ON K1P 5S9</p>
<p>For electronic applications, the completed form and supporting documentation can be sent to
<a href="mailto:forms-formulaires@cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca">forms-formulaires@cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca</a>.</p>
<p>The applicant should keep a completed copy of the application for their records. All information submitted is subject to the provisions of the <em>Access to Information Act</em> and the <em>Privacy Act</em>.</p>
<h3><a name="P168_13411" id="P168_13411"></a>4.3 Examination </h3>
<p>The content of the examination will be tailored to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the operational risks of the licensed activity and equipment</li>
<li>the organization&#8217;s policies and procedures</li>
<li>the candidate&#8217;s academic background and work experience</li>
</ul>
<p>The examination will normally be conducted in the form of an oral examination.</p>
<p>An examination can be expected to last no more than two hours.</p>
<h4>4.3.1 Examination results and re-examination</h4>
<p>The CNSC will communicate examination results to the licensee and the candidate within 10 working days following the examination.</p>
<h4>4.3.1.1 Certification </h4>
<p>If the candidate is able to clearly demonstrate to the CNSC their knowledge, as it relates to the RSO position within their organization, the CNSC will certify the candidate. </p>
<p>The certification comes into effect the day the certificate is issued.</p>
<h4>4.3.1.2 Refusal to certify</h4>
<p>If the candidate is unable to demonstrate to the CNSC their knowledge, as it relates to the RSO position within their organization, the CNSC will not certify the candidate. </p>
<p>After an examination, if certification refusal is being considered, the CNSC shall notify the licensee and the candidate of the proposed decision and the basis for that proposed decision, at least 30 days before the refusal is issued (as per section 15.07 of the <em>Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment Regulations</em>). Within this 30-day period, the licensee or the candidate may request an opportunity to be heard as described in section 4.3.5 of this document.</p>
<p>As part of the notification of its proposed decision not to certify, the CNSC will provide information regarding the subject areas for which the candidate failed to demonstrate adequate knowledge. </p>
<p>Once the CNSC refuses to certify a candidate, the candidate may not assume the title of RSO, nor can the candidate carry out the duties required as an RSO.</p>
<p>More details on the basis for a refusal to certify can be found in Appendix A.</p>
<h4>4.3.1.2.1 Re-examination</h4>
<p>If a candidate fails to qualify for certification after a first attempt at an examination, the candidate may request a second examination. A request for re-examination must be communicated to the CNSC within 30 days of receiving the notification of the proposed decision to not certify, otherwise the licensee will be issued a <em>Refusal to Certify.</em></p>
<h4>4.3.2 Decertification</h4>
<p>An RSO may be decertified when, in the opinion of the CNSC, the person is no longer able to serve as RSO. If decertification of an RSO is being considered, the RSO and the licensee concerned shall be notified of the proposed decision and the basis for that proposed decision at least 30 days before decertification, as per section 15.08 of the <em>Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment Regulations</em>. Within this 30-day period, the licensee and the RSO may request an opportunity to be heard, as described in section 4.3.5 of this document.</p>
<p>Scenarios that may lead to decertification include:</p>
<ol>
<li>evidence of significant or willful non-compliance with NSCA, or the regulations made under the NSCA</li>
<li>evidence of incompetence</li>
<li> the RSO is otherwise incapable of performing duties</li>
<li> request by licensee to decertify RSO</li>
</ol>
<p>If for any reason, a certified RSO is decertified by the CNSC, that person must wait three years before being eligible for certification again. </p>
<h4>4.3.2.1 Certification following decertification</h4>
<p>A decertified person may request to be certified again if:</p>
<ol>
<li>the basis for the refusal to certify person is no longer applicable</li>
<li>the person successfully passes the requirements for certification</li>
</ol>
<h4>4.3.3 Certificate invalidation</h4>
<p>A certificate is no longer valid if any substantive conditions of the original certification change, thereby nullifying the certificate. A certificate is not invalidated by the CNSC, but rather by a change in circumstances. In many cases, the invalidation will require the RSO to undergo re-certification. </p>
<p>Typical scenarios that can lead to the invalidation of a certificate are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The RSO is no longer employed by the licensee, as stipulated in section 15.05 of the <em>Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment Regulations.</em></li>
<li>The person occupying the position of RSO has changed duties to another position within the same organization, where the person&#8217;s new duties are substantially different from that of an RSO.</li>
<li>The certified person will be working at a different site that belongs to the same licensee. In such a case, the RSO is required to undergo certification regarding the facilities&#8217; policies and procedures specific to that site.</li>
<li>The person has been away from RSO duties for an extended period of time, as described in section 4.5.2.</li>
</ol>
<p>If new types of facilities are added at a given site, the existing certificate will not cover the new facilities. Consequently, the licensee will need to apply for certification for these new types of facilities. If a certified RSO is successful in their application to oversee the new facilities, their previously held certificate will be invalidated only after a new one has been issued.</p>
<p>Example: A given licensee has only linear accelerators at a given site, and one RSO who is certified for these linear accelerators. If the licensee would like to add a high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy facility, the licensee must request that their RSO (or a different candidate) undergo certification for the HDR brachytherapy facility. </p>
<h4>4.3.3.1 Certification following invalidation</h4>
<p>If a certificate is invalidated by a change in circumstances or a change in licensing, the licensee may request that the previously certified person be certified again if any of the following apply:</p>
<ol>
<li>The person is seeking to retain the position of RSO at the current site. </li>
<li>The person is seeking to assume the position of RSO at a different site or different organization.</li>
</ol>
<p>An examination may be required for the above stated circumstances, which will be determined on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<h4>4.3.4 Expiration of certificates</h4>
<p>As stated in section 15.05 of the <em>Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment Regulations</em>, once a certificate is issued, it remains valid for the period for which the person is employed by the licensee as RSO. Thus, certificates, unlike licences, do not expire and do not require renewals, though they may be invalidated by circumstances as listed in section 4.3.3, or revoked as a result of decertification as described in section 4.3.2 of this document.</p>
<h4>4.3.5 Opportunity to be heard</h4>
<p>If a licensee or a candidate for certification receives a notice from the CNSC, stating its intent to refuse to certify the candidate (or a notice of intent to decertify, in the case of an RSO), the licensee, candidate or RSO may request, within 30 days after the date of receipt of the notice, an opportunity to be heard orally or in writing. </p>
<p>Upon completion of the hearing, the licensee or the candidate or the RSO shall be notified of the CNSC&#8217;s final decision and the reasons for it.</p>
<h3><a name="P221_20313" id="P221_20313"></a>4.4 Absences and designation of temporary replacements </h3>
<h4>4.4.1 Temporary absence from duties</h4>
<p>The licensee shall ensure that a certified RSO who is temporarily absent from their position maintains the competence to retain their certification. Upon returning from their absence, the person must meet the conditions of reinstatement prior to resuming the duties of RSO.</p>
<h4>4.4.1.1 Reinstatement following a temporary absence from duties</h4>
<h4>4.4.1.1.1 Absence of 60 days or less</h4>
<p>A certified individual who has been absent from the duties of RSO for 60 consecutive working days or less, may be reinstated by the licensee without any restrictions.</p>
<h4>4.4.1.1.2 Absence of more than 60 days, but less than 13 calendar months</h4>
<p>Following an absence of more than 60 consecutive working days but less than 13 calendar months, the person may be reinstated only if:</p>
<ol>
<li> the person has reviewed, at a minimum, the following material:
<ol className="lower-alpha">
<li>basic radiation safety</li>
<li> refresher of the radiation protection program, and any changes to policies and procedures</li>
<li> changes to Class II prescribed equipment</li>
<li> changes to regulatory requirements</li>
<li> changes to Class II licences and their referenced documents</li>
<li> operational incidents that have occurred during the absence</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li> the licensee has provided written confirmation to the CNSC that the above-mentioned review has been completed, and that the individual has the required knowledge and skills to resume the duties of RSO</li>
</ol>
<h4>4.4.2 Extended absence from duties</h4>
<p>If a person has been absent from RSO duties for reasons such as:</p>
<ol>
<li> illness </li>
<li> injury </li>
<li> pregnancy, or other family-related responsibilities</li>
<li> a leave of absence</li>
<li> temporary assignment to other duties </li>
</ol>
<p>for a period exceeding 13 consecutive calendar months, the person may not resume the role as RSO, and their certification is deemed invalid. If the person wishes to resume the duties of RSO, they will have to be recertified.</p>
<h4>4.4.3 Designating a temporary replacement as Radiation Safety Officer</h4>
<p>The licensee shall designate in writing a temporary replacement, as per section 15.1 of the <em>Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment Regulations</em>. The replacement must be qualified to replace the RSO, although the replacement need not be certified.</p>
<p>As per section 15.11 of the <em>Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment Regulations</em>, a designated replacement may not replace the certified RSO for more than a total of 60 consecutive working days in any 365-day period. Thus, any absence in excess of this requires the temporary replacement to be certified.</p>

<a name="appendixA"></a>
<h2><a name="P289_27891" id="P289_27891"></a>Appendix&nbsp;A: Basis for Refusal</h2>
<p>Certification examinations cover the following topics, in relation to the types of Class II prescribed equipment and facilities for which the applicant has requested certification: </p>
<ol>
<li> relevant provisions of the NSCA and its ensuing regulations</li>
<li> principles of radiation safety</li>
<li> radiation physics</li>
<li> operational activities and facilities which are to be licensed by the CNSC</li>
<li> Radiation Protection Program of the facility</li>
</ol>
<p>If, during the examination, a candidate fails to demonstrate a reasonable level of knowledge with respect to one or more of these categories, this can lead to a <em>Refusal to Certify</em>. </p>
<p>If a certified RSO is seeking certification for a new facility type at the site for which he is currently RSO, and fails the examination for this new facility type, the <em>Refusal to Certify</em> will apply only to the new facility type, and does not affect their current certification. Thus, the RSO remains certified, but a different candidate will need to be selected to undergo RSO certification for the new facility types.</p>
<p>If a previously uncertified candidate fails to qualify for certification as RSO, this does not preclude the person from being certified as an RSO for a different licensee, should the candidate change employers within the two-year period after the CNSC refuses to certify the candidate</p>

<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>This regulatory document&nbsp;is part of the CNSC&#39;s&nbsp;Human Performance Management series of regulatory documents, which also covers human performance programs and personnel certification. The full&nbsp;list of regulatory document series&nbsp;is included in the back of this document and can be found on the CNSC&#8217;s Web site at <a href="/eng/acts-and-regulations/regulatory-documents/index">nuclearsafety.gc.ca/regulatory-documents</a>.</p>
<p>REGDOC-2.2.2, <em>Personnel Training</em> sets out requirements and guidance for the analysis, design, development, implementation, evaluation, documentation and management of training at nuclear facilities within Canada, including the principles and elements essential to an effective training system.</p>
<p>As one of many management programs used within an organization&#8217;s management system, the training system supports the organization&#8217;s operational capability by providing workers with the training they require to perform their jobs effectively. In addition, a training system permits organizations to respond rapidly to strategic guidance when an assessment of need indicates that a performance or personnel issue can best be addressed by training.</p>
<p>Consistent with the CNSC&#8217;s regulatory philosophy and with international practice, licensees are responsible for the safe operation of their respective nuclear facilities. Consequently, licensees are responsible for training and assessing their workers to ensure that they are fully qualified to perform the duties of their position in accordance with current regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>This document is intended to form part of the licensing basis for a regulated facility or activity. It is intended for inclusion in licences as either part of the conditions and safety and control measures in a licence, or as part of the safety and control measures to be described in a licence application and the documents needed to support that application.</p>
<p className="border-highlight"><strong>Important note: </strong>Where  referenced in a licence either directly or indirectly (such as through  licensee-referenced documents), this document is part of the licensing basis  for a regulated facility or activity.<br />
<br />
The licensing basis sets the  boundary conditions for acceptable performance at a regulated facility or  activity and establishes the basis for the CNSC&#39;s compliance program for that  regulated facility or activity. <br />

<h2 id="P103_4841">1.0 Introduction </h2>
<p>The purpose of training in the nuclear industry is to ensure that workers are competent and qualified to perform the duties of their position. As required by the <em>General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations</em>, workers shall be trained to carry on the licensed activity. </p>
<p>A training system provides the basis for defining, designing, developing, implementing, evaluating, recording and managing training for workers at nuclear facilities. It provides a method for meeting the training needs of workers and ensuring that the right people receive the right training at the right time. With a training system, as defined in this regulatory document, it can be demonstrated that all required knowledge, skills, abilities and attitudes have been attained, through the process of performance-based assessment and program evaluation. Without a training system, there is the risk that important elements of training will be omitted and the operating state of the facility will not be reflected in the training programs.</p>
<h3 id="P106_5866">1.1 Purpose</h3>
<p>This regulatory document sets out the requirements of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) for licensees regarding the development and implementation of a training system. It also provides guidance on how these requirements should be met.</p>
<h3 id="P108_6124">1.2 Scope</h3>
<p>This regulatory document applies to all workers in nuclear facilities who are employed in safety-sensitive occupations and/or safety-sensitive positions. </p>
<p>In addition, this regulatory document applies to the entire lifecycle of the facility including site selection, design, construction, commissioning, operation, refurbishment and decommissioning. It can apply to individual structures, systems and components, as well as to the entire facility. </p>
<h3 id="P111_6580">1.3 Relevant legislation</h3>
<p>The provisions of the <em>Nuclear Safety and Control Act</em> (NSCA) and regulations that are relevant to this regulatory document include:</p>
<ol>
<li> paragraph&nbsp;12(1)(a) of the <em>General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations</em>, which states every licensee shall &#8220;ensure the presence of a sufficient number of qualified workers to carry on the licensed activity safely and in accordance with the Act, the regulations made under the Act and the licence&#8221;</li>
<li> paragraph&nbsp;12(1)(b) of the <em>General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations</em>, which states every licensee shall &#8220;train the workers to carry on the licensed activity in accordance with the Act, the regulations made under the Act and the licence&#8221;</li>

<h2 id="P115_7288">2.0 Principles</h2>
<p>The training system developed and implemented by each licensee shall adhere to the following three fundamental principles:</p>
<ol>
<li> <strong>Performance oriented:</strong> Training is preparation for performance on the job. All instruction shall focus on essential knowledge, skills, abilities and attitudes required to meet job requirements and nuclear-safety-specific needs over the lifecycle of the facility.</li>
<li><strong> Systematically developed: </strong>Training shall be defined, produced and maintained through an iterative and interactive series of steps, leading from the identification of a training requirement to the confirmation that the requirement has been satisfied.</li>
<li> <strong>Tailored to audience:</strong> Training shall be tailored to the needs and the learning characteristics of the target population.</li>

<h2 id="P120_8062">3.0 Requirements for a training system for nuclear facilities</h2>
<p>Licensees shall use a training system to systematically define, design, develop, implement, evaluate, record and manage all training, including continuing training, for all workers who are employed in safety-sensitive occupations and/or safety-sensitive positions. </p>
<p>The licensee shall propose to the CNSC, through their license application, all safety-sensitive occupations and/or safety-sensitive positions to which this regulatory document applies and the CNSC will review and approve these occupations and/or positions through the licensing process. </p>
<p>The training system shall be applied during the analysis, design, development, implementation, evaluation, documentation and management of new training or the revision of existing training. It shall be used whether the training is defined, designed, developed, implemented, evaluated, recorded and managed internally by licensees or externally through vendors or contractors. </p>
<p>The level of analysis, documentation and actions may vary in proportion to the relative importance to safety, safeguards and security; the magnitude of any hazard involved; the lifecycle stage of the facility; the mission of the facility; the particular characteristics of the facility; and any other relevant factors. </p>
<p>Licensees shall:</p>
<ol>
<li> establish and implement a training system that ensures their training programs are systematically defined, designed, developed, implemented, evaluated, recorded and managed</li>
<li> use a training system to provide a logical progression from an analysis of the training requirements and identification of the qualifications and competencies required for performing a job, to the design, development, implementation, evaluation and management of training. This shall include the respective training materials, and the subsequent evaluation and continuous improvement of the training courses and training programs</li>
<li> identify all performance requirements of a capability, job or duty by conducting a job analysis to determine all of the tasks, subtasks and task elements involved</li>
<li>define and document the necessary general worker training, initial job training and continuing training requirements for workers, based on a task analysis of the knowledge, skills, abilities and attitudes required to perform the duties of their position</li>
<li> ensure that appropriate training is designed, developed and implemented to meet the qualification and competency requirements</li>
<li> ensure that trainers meet and maintain documented qualification and competency requirements, particularly in the areas of subject matter expertise and instructional skills</li>
<li> ensure that formal evaluations are used to confirm and document that each trained worker is qualified and competent to perform the duties of his or her position</li>
<li> implement a training change management process that will systematically analyze procedural and equipment changes, changes in job descriptions, and operating experience feedback (including facility and industry-wide events) in order to identify changes to the tasks and task lists, and to assess potential training implications leading to modifications in the training programs</li>
<li> ensure continuing training is provided to workers and that it includes&nbsp;updates to&nbsp;training programs stemming from the change management process</li>
<li> evaluate the training programs regularly and incorporate the results of the evaluations into a training program improvement process</li>
<li> ensure that workers have been trained in current procedures and in relevant system and equipment configurations and are competent to perform the duties of their position </li>
<li> ensure that workers&#8217; records in support of training and qualifications are established and maintained</li>
<li> ensure that workers have a level of training related to nuclear safety including but not limited to radiation safety, fire safety, onsite emergency arrangements, and conventional health and safety corresponding to the duties of their position and employment</li>

<h2 id="P142_13098">5.0 Guidance on the systematic approach to training</h2>
<p>Licensees may adopt the systematic approach to training (SAT) methodology to meet the requirements in section 3.0 of this document. SAT is a proven and highly successful education and training methodology, which, when implemented as outlined below, will meet the requirements of this regulatory document. It is also widely known as the instructional systems design model (ISDM).</p>
<p>The SAT methodology is the industry standard for training development and is the most widely practiced model in existence today. SAT is a holistic process and a proven best practice for the analysis, design, development, implementation, evaluation and management of training.</p>
<p>A SAT-based training system provides interdependent functions consisting of analysis, design, development, implementation and evaluation. It is this cyclic process, as depicted in Figure 1, that enables training to be systematically defined, designed, developed, implemented and evaluated in order to not only meet operational and organizational requirements, but also to react quickly to changes in those requirements.</p>

<p><a href="regdoc2-2-2/longdesc/training-e.html">Systematic Approach text version</a></p>
<h3 id="P149_14295">5.1 Analysis phase</h3>
<p>The analysis phase is the foundation of any training course or training program and includes inputs from operational staff, end-users, subject matter experts (SMEs) and training development experts. Its purpose is to specify the required outcome of the training in terms of essential on-the-job performance as defined by role documents, procedures or written instructions. The analysis should consider the following points: </p>
<ul>
<li>rationale and purpose of training</li>
<li>scope of the training</li>
<li>target audience</li>
<li>training method</li>
<li>location of the training</li>
<li>timeframe by when the training must be complete</li>
</ul>
<p>There are various components required to facilitate a full training analysis as described in the following paragraphs.</p>
<h4 id="P158_15034">5.1.1 Training needs analysis</h4>
<p>A training needs analysis (TNA) is normally triggered by a performance gap or deficiency which has identified training as the solution. Engineering design and equipment changes, operational changes, revised procedures, and modifications to regulatory requirements are examples of changes that would generate performance gaps. A TNA systematically assesses the job performance requirements against actual existing performance (gap analysis) and identifies specific areas that require training.</p>
<h4 id="P160_15557">5.1.2 Job and task analysis</h4>
<p>To identify all performance requirements of a capability, job or duty, a job analysis should be conducted to determine all of the tasks, subtasks and task elements involved with all states of the nuclear facility, including normal operations, accident conditions and emergency situations. The end result of a job analysis is a list of tasks that should be completed to perform the job correctly. Task difficulty, importance and frequency are considered to determine which tasks need to be part of training and to determine the initial and continuing training content. Task analysis should be conducted to determine the method of task performance and associated knowledge, skills and abilities.</p>
<h4 id="P162_16277">5.1.3 Learning objectives </h4>
<p>Learning objectives (LOs) are statements of the desired knowledge, skills, abilities and attitudes that workers must be able to demonstrate after completing the training. LOs should be measurable and define exactly when, what and how well the trainee must be capable of performing on the job upon completion of the training.</p>
<p>A learning objective should include:</p>
<ol>
<li>a performance statement: states the task to be performed using one observable action verb</li>
<li>a condition statement: describes conditions under which the performance must be completed</li>
<li>standards: state at least one measurable criterion which describes how well the performance should be completed</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="P168_16964">5.1.4 Target audience analysis </h4>
<p>A target audience analysis determines the numbers and categories of workers to be trained and, where possible, the characteristics of the individuals who will receive the training (e.g., current job experience and prior background, experience, education and training). This information ensures that the training is designed, developed and implemented at the correct level, and assists with determining any necessary training prerequisites. </p>
<h3 id="P170_17435">5.2 Design phase </h3>
<p>The design phase should include the selection and description of the training and an environment that will enable the trainees to achieve the LOs determined in the analysis phase. The design phase starts with the results of the analysis phase and ends with a plan for the development of the training. The design phase takes the output from the analysis phase and specifies how the information will be presented and how the knowledge, skills, abilities and attitudes will be tested. </p>
<p>The fundamental processes of the design phase are briefly described in the following paragraphs. </p>
<h4 id="P173_18032">5.2.1 Trainee characteristics </h4>
<p>As a result of the analysis phase, the target audience should have been broadly defined. Trainee characteristics should be described in terms of their entry-level knowledge, skills, abilities and attitudes, and those characteristics likely to affect their responses to particular instructional activities. Information obtained in this process will guide subsequent decisions such as those regarding appropriate instructional sequences, methods and media.</p>
<h4 id="P175_18516">5.2.2 Instructional program design</h4>
<p>The instructional program design determines in more detail the knowledge, skills, abilities and attitudes required to perform a task which is defined in enabling objectives (EOs). These enabling objectives are then grouped and sequenced into the order most suitable for learning. </p>
<h4 id="P177_18831">5.2.3 Enabling objectives </h4>
<p>EOs are the principal units of learning and constitute a major step towards achieving the associated LOs. EOs are sub-components of the LOs. EOs represent manageable units of work: units that are coherent in terms of logic, learning of work, have a suitable scope and are appropriate for testing learning progress. Like the LO, the EO is composed of three essential parts: </p>
<ol>
<li> The performance statement; an observable action such as &#8220;Operate a global positioning system&#8221; or &#8220;Install the Personnel Record Management software.&#8221; It should be stated as one action associated with a single verb. If the action is complicated or if more than one verb is used, then the task needs to be broken down further into other EOs with simple actions.</li>
<li> The conditions statement; a description of the setting or conditions under which the task is to be performed (e.g., &#8220;given a PC with presentation software&#8221;, &#8220;denied reference&#8221; and &#8220;without supervision&#8221;). Ideally, the conditions should mirror those in the workplace where the operation is performed. </li>
<li> The standard; one or more measurable criterion stating the level of acceptable performance of the task in terms of quantity, quality or time limitations. It should answer questions such as: &#8220;How many?&#8221; &#8220;How fast?&#8221; or &#8220;How well?&#8221; (e.g., the italicized portion of &#8220;Given a PC with presentation software, <em>create a presentation with at least six slides in less than 30 minutes</em>&#8221;).</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="P182_20307">5.2.4 Learning assessment plan </h4>
<p>A learning assessment plan describes the use of testing in support of the training and formal evaluation. The learning assessment plan determines how progress toward, and achievement of, the required performance is checked and verified. While an assessment should be based upon the performance defined in the LO, limiting factors, such as time, may not permit direct observation of the full range of the desired performance. The assessment plan describes how a valid and reliable sample of trainee performance will be measured and evaluated.</p>
<h4 id="P184_20879">5.2.5 Instructional strategies </h4>
<p>The instructional strategy is the combination of media, methods and environment used in the delivery of training. The advantages and disadvantages of each instructional strategy, as applied to the LOs, should be examined to ensure that the most effective solution is selected to produce graduates capable of performing tasks as indicated in the LOs. </p>
<h4 id="P186_21260">5.2.6 On-the-job training </h4>
<p>On-the-job training (OJT) requirements should be considered when one or more of the LOs may not be suitable for traditional instruction methods. However, additional OJT requirements may arise in the design phase when there is a shortfall between the LOs and the EOs. This typically occurs when the training environment cannot simulate the operational task. If OJT is necessary, then OJT learning objectives, complete with performance statements, conditions and standards, should be produced. Subsequently, each OJT learning objective should be formally assessed using on-the-job evaluation (OJE).</p>
<h4 id="P188_21882">5.2.7 Training plan</h4>
<p>The training plan describes the training and documents the decisions made during the design phase on items such as the EOs, teaching points, method of instruction for each EO, key learning events, sequence of instruction, and assessment procedures.</p>
<h3 id="P190_22149">5.3 Development phase </h3>
<p>The development phase involves the procurement or production of effective instructional materials in accordance with the training plan. </p>
<p>The development phase incorporates the following processes.</p>
<h4 id="P193_22366">5.3.1 Procurement/production of instructional materials</h4>
<p>The instructional materials should support the learning activities. Such items include instructor lesson plans, interactive courseware such as computer-based training (CBT) and training aids of all types including equipment, references, job aids and testing materials. The instructional materials should include the following, where necessary:</p>
<ol>
<li> Trainee manuals: These are reference handbooks to be used and retained by the trainees.</li>
<li> Instructor guides: These are instructional specifications for use by the instructor during training preparation and delivery. They outline the specific training steps that must be provided to satisfy the training plan. EOs are linked to detailed steps and procedures in the trainee manuals, user guides and any online documentation. </li>
<li> Handouts: These additional aids can supplement the trainee manuals in areas identified as difficult and/or particularly important. </li>
<li> CBT or other media: These are to be used where they are a recommended solution based on the instructional analysis and the selection of the instructional strategy.</li>
<li> Question banks and some sample tests in a numbered sequence: When used during the training, these should include guidance on where and when they should be used.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="P200_23653">5.3.2 Assessment tests</h4>
<p>Assessment tests, which address the requirement for formal evaluation, cover both progress and final testing. In general, there are two types and both should be developed. </p>
<p> Knowledge or cognitive assessments: Usually written, these tests can include multiple choice, multiple response, dichotomous or binary (i.e., yes/no; true/false), matching, resequencing, and open-ended questions.</p>
<p> Performance or skill-based assessments: These are practical tests based on realistic scenarios of the most important and significant skills and abilities derived from the LOs and EOs. </p>
<h4 id="P204_24249">5.3.3 Conduct of trials (pilot courses) </h4>
<p>To assess the effectiveness of the training and related materials, these materials should be reviewed by SMEs, tested with individuals who are representative of the target training audience, and approved by the appropriate managers. The training and instructional materials should be revised according to the findings of the trials.</p>
<h3 id="P206_24623">5.4 Implementation phase </h3>
<p>The implementation phase is to enable the trainees to successfully perform the tasks to the standards defined in the LOs. This phase encompasses both the instructor preparation phase as well as the actual delivery of the training. </p>
<p>It should include:</p>
<ol>
<li> detailed lesson plans (produced by the instructors) based on the training plan and the instructor guides prepared during the development phase</li>
<li>set-up of the training environment</li>
<li> continual monitoring to ensure that learning is taking place</li>
<li> arrangements for follow-on training, where necessary</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="P213_25197">5.5 Evaluation phase</h3>
<p>The evaluation phase involves the assessment of the effectiveness and efficiency of the training as delivered and verification of whether the trainees have mastered the LOs and acquired the competence needed to perform the job safely. </p>
<p>The evaluation phase includes the following:</p>
<ol>
<li> Formal trainee evaluation: The trainees&#8217; abilities to perform the tasks, as defined in the LOs, should be measured through tests and assessments. This activity can be included as a process within the implementation phase.</li>
<li> Content and delivery: All instructional activities are monitored so that corrective actions, including trainee evaluations, can be taken if necessary. Sources of feedback include the trainees, the instructors, the support staff and the responsible managers and supervisors. </li>
<li> Effectiveness: This means the graduates&#8217; ability to perform, in the workplace, the tasks for which they were trained. The primary sources of this information are the graduates and their supervisors. Additionally, information may be available through various sources ranging from needs assessments and lessons-learned reports to incident reports and rework statistics. Managers and supervisors should have continuous input to the training.</li>
<li> Change management: In accordance with the principles of a SAT methodology, inputs such as new or revised regulatory requirements, engineering design and equipment changes, operational changes, revised procedures, modifications and operating experience feedback (including facility and industry-wide events) should be regularly fed into the appropriate processes through the analysis phase.</li>

<h2>Preface</h2>  <p>This regulatory document is part of the CNSC&#39;s Public and Aboriginal Engagement series of regulatory documents, which also covers public information and disclosure. The full list of regulatory document series is included at the end of this document and can also be found on the <a href="/eng/acts-and-regulations/regulatory-documents/index">CNSC&#39;s  website</a>.</p>   <p>Regulatory document REGDOC-3.2.2, <em>Aboriginal Engagement</em>, sets out the  requirements and guidance for licensees on Aboriginal engagement. As defined in  the <em>Constitution Act, 1982</em>, references  to Aboriginal groups and communities in this document include Indian, Inuit and  M&eacute;tis peoples of Canada. For the purposes of this document, &quot;licensee&quot; refers  to new licence applicants and existing licensees, and &quot;regulated facility or  activity&quot; refers to proposed or existing regulated facilities and activities.  &quot;CNSC&quot; refers to CNSC staff and &quot;the Commission&quot; refers to the administrative  tribunal.</p>  <p>While this document is intended to apply generally  to regulated facilities and activities described in the <em>Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations</em> and the <em>Uranium Mines and Mills Regulations</em>, it may not apply to all  facilities and/or activities described by those regulations. As appropriate,  the CNSC may also request information from licensees related to Aboriginal  engagement for facilities and/or activities not described in the <em>Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations</em> and the <em>Uranium Mines and Mills Regulations</em>. </p>  <p>This  document is not a comprehensive guide on Aboriginal engagement, and it does not  interpret treaties under section&nbsp;35 of the <em>Constitution Act, 1982</em>, or replicate information provided in the <em>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012</em> (CEAA 2012) or other environmental statutes or guidelines. Rather, REGDOC-3.2.2  provides procedural direction for licensees, in support of the broader approach  to Aboriginal consultation implemented by the CNSC in cooperation with federal  departments and agencies. </p>  <p>This document supersedes <em>Supplementary Information for Licensees: Aboriginal Consultation</em> (published  in 2011). The  requirements in this document are in addition to those found in RD/GD-99.3, <em>Public Information and Disclosure</em>, and  are meant to ensure that potential or established Aboriginal and/or treaty  rights and related interests,  including Aboriginal title (an Aboriginal right to the exclusive use and occupation  of land), are  considered, as appropriate.</p>  <p>For  further information on the CNSC&#39;s approach to Aboriginal consultation, refer to  the external policy found in the <em>Codification  of Current Practice: Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) Commitment to Aboriginal Consultation</em>. The CNSC approach is informed by the guiding  principles outlined in Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada&#39;s <em>Aboriginal  Consultation and Accommodation - Updated Guidelines for Federal Officials to  Fulfill the Duty to Consult.</em></p>  <p>REGDOC-3.2.2 is intended to form part of the licensing basis for a regulated facility or activity within the scope of the document.</p>  <p>Guidance contained in this document exists to inform the licensee, to elaborate further on requirements or to provide direction to licensees on how to meet requirements. It also provides more information about how CNSC staff evaluate specific problems or data during the review of licence applications. Licensees are expected to review and consider guidance; should they choose not to follow it, they should explain how their chosen alternate approach meets regulatory requirements.</p>
<div className="alert alert-info col-md-12">  <h3><span className="">Important note</span></h3>  <p>Where referenced in a licence either directly or indirectly (such as through licensee-referenced documents), this document is part of the licensing basis for a regulated facility or activity.</p>
<p>The licensing basis sets the boundary conditions for acceptable performance at a regulated facility or activity and establishes the basis for the CNSC&#39;s compliance program for that regulated facility or activity.</p>  <p>Where this document is part of the licensing basis, the word &quot;shall&quot; is used to express a requirement to be satisfied by the licensee or licence applicant. &quot;Should&quot; is used to express guidance or that which is advised. &quot;May&quot; is used to express an option or that which is advised or permissible within the limits of this regulatory document. &quot;Can&quot; is used to express possibility or capability.</p>  <p>Nothing contained in this document is to be construed as relieving any licensee from any other pertinent requirements. It is the licensee&#39;s responsibility to identify and comply with all applicable regulations and licence conditions.</p>  </div> <div className="col-md-12 module-table-contents">  <h2>Table of Contents</h2>  <ul>  <li><a href="#sec1">1 Introduction</a>

<h2 id="sec2">2. Background</h2>  <p>The CNSC&#39;s approach to Aboriginal consultation includes  commitments to uphold the honour of the Crown, through relationship building  and information sharing, as well as to meet the CNSC&#39;s legal obligations under  section 35 of the <em>Constitution Act, 1982</em>.</p>  <p>Since 2004, the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) has held that the Crown (federal, provincial  and territorial governments) has a duty to consult. The SCC has also held that  the Crown has a duty to accommodate, where appropriate, when it contemplates  conduct that might adversely impact potential or established Aboriginal and/or  treaty rights and related interests, including Aboriginal title.</p>  <p>The SCC has subsequently clarified responsibilities  related to the duty to consult, noting that entities such as boards and tribunals,  including the CNSC, also play a role in fulfilling the duty. The CNSC meets  these responsibilities through Aboriginal consultation activities, and its  approach is articulated in the  <em>Codification of Current Practice:  Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) Commitment to Aboriginal Consultation</em>.  This document is available on the <a href="http://www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca/">CNSC&#39;s  website</a>.</p>  <p>The SCC has also stated that the Crown may  procedurally delegate aspects of the consultation process to third parties,  such as licensees. The CNSC may rely on licensees for proposed measures to  avoid, mitigate or offset adverse impacts to potential or established Aboriginal and/or treaty rights and related  interests, including Aboriginal title, and to accommodate these rights where appropriate.</p><p>In June 2014, the SCC granted Aboriginal title for  the first time to a specific land area in Canada, and it clarified the  application of provincial laws and regulatory regimes to Aboriginal title  lands.</p>  <p>Licensees&#39; Aboriginal engagement activities help  determine if a regulated facility or activity could potentially impact rights  and related interests, including  Aboriginal title, and help inform the CNSC&#39;s approach to Aboriginal  consultation activities.</p>  <p>The CNSC&#39;s Aboriginal consultation  activities can vary for each regulated facility or activity. Table&nbsp;1  depicts the consultation activity spectrum that the CNSC uses to consider the  relevant factors for a specific regulated facility or activity, and to determine  appropriate consultation activities.</p>  <table className="table table-striped">

<h2 id="sec3">3. Licensee Requirements for Aboriginal Engagement</h2>  <p>When licensees propose regulated facilities or activities that could adversely impact potential or established Aboriginal and/or treaty rights and related interests, including Aboriginal title, they shall engage with potentially impacted Aboriginal groups at a level commensurate with the significance of the potential impact on those rights and related interests, including Aboriginal title.</p>  <p>For any regulated facility or activity that could adversely impact potential or established Aboriginal and/or treaty rights and related interests, including Aboriginal title, licensees shall include an Aboriginal engagement plan and report within a project description or licence application. Refer to draft REGDOC-2.9.1, <em>Environmental Protection: Environmental Assessment</em>, for additional information on the requirements and guidance for the conduct of environmental assessments (EAs) under the NSCA and of EAs under the CEAA 2012.</p>  <p><strong>Guidance</strong>  <p>It is essential that licensees submit accurate,  complete information, as this helps the CNSC to ensure an adequate Aboriginal consultation  process, to determine the appropriate level of Aboriginal consultation  activities, and to carry out an effective and efficient EA and/or licensing  review. These details are also critical to informing the Commission in its  decision-making.</p>  <p>If licensees conduct Aboriginal engagement  activities outside of the scope of this document or in support of due  diligence, they are encouraged to share any relevant information with the CNSC,  when available.</p>  <p>The CNSC will inform licensees in a timely manner if, during the EA or  licensing process, it becomes aware of previously unidentified issues  or impacts to potential or established Aboriginal and/or treaty rights and related interests, including  Aboriginal title, that could also be  addressed through licensee Aboriginal engagement activities.</p>

<h4 id="sec3-2-1">3.2.1 Content of Aboriginal engagement plan and report</h4>  <p><strong>Guidance</strong>  <p><strong><em>Identification of Aboriginal groups and rationale</em></strong></p>  <p>In the Aboriginal engagement plan and report, licensees should include a list of Aboriginal groups identified for engagement activities, and the rationale for identification.</p>  <p>Key factors to consider when determining which Aboriginal groups to engage include:</p>  <ul>
<li>historic or modern treaties in the  region of the regulated facility or activity </li>
<li>potential impacts to the health  and safety of the public, the environment and any potential or established  Aboriginal and/or treaty rights and related interests, including Aboriginal  title</li>
<li>proximity of the regulated  facility or activity to Aboriginal communities</li>
<li>Aboriginal community engagement  protocols and agreements  </li>
<li>traditional territories </li>
<li>traditional and current use of  lands</li>
<li>settled or ongoing land claims</li>
<li>settled or ongoing litigation  related to a potentially impacted group</li>
<li>membership in a tribal council or Aboriginal umbrella group </li>
<li>governance structure (i.e.,  confirming the names of elected or designated authorities who represent the  Band and/or Aboriginal organization)</li>  </ul>  <p>Appendix A contains a more extensive list of considerations that may assist in directing the scope and content of Aboriginal engagement activities.</p>  <p>Licensees are also encouraged to contact the CNSC for additional information about its approach to Aboriginal consultation activities.</p>  <p>Once contact is established with Aboriginal groups, licensees should ask the groups how they would like to be engaged, as preferences may vary by community. The CNSC encourages the development of an engagement work plan that is reasonable to both parties. When engaging with Aboriginal groups, there may also be a need to address different linguistic, cultural, geographic or informational needs and to allow for a flexible approach to engagement. When developing an Aboriginal engagement work plan, licensees should consider the following:</p>  <ul>
<li>assignment of a consistent representative </li>
<li>face-to-face meetings </li>
<li>incorporation of a variety of engagement  forums and techniques (e.g., letters, phone calls, presentations, working  groups)</li>
<li>schedules and workloads of the Aboriginal  groups involved</li>
<li>potential engagement protocols </li>
<li>translation of information into the native  languages of the Aboriginal groups engaged, where appropriate </li>
<li>communication with identified Aboriginal groups  throughout the licensing period of the regulated facility or activity</li>  </ul>  <p>Licensees should provide Aboriginal groups with:</p>  <ul>
<li>preliminary information on the nature and  scope of the regulated facility or activity and its potential impact on the  environment </li>
<li>possible mitigation measures, such as involving Aboriginal groups in the  development, implementation and review of mitigation measures</li>  </ul>  <p><strong><em>Summary of Aboriginal engagement activities to date</em></strong></p>  <p>Before submitting a licence application or project description, licensees should conduct Aboriginal engagement activities as early as possible if one or more of the following criteria apply:</p>  <ul>
<li>the proposal falls outside of the  licensing basis, such as changes to the size of the footprint of a facility</li>
<li>the proposal can result in changes  to the environment</li>
<li>the proposal may adversely impact  an Aboriginal group&#39;s ability to practice its potential or established  Aboriginal and/or treaty rights and related interests, including Aboriginal  title</li>  </ul>  <p>Early engagement provides Aboriginal groups with an opportunity to share information on local and Aboriginal traditional knowledge that helps to identify potential impacts from the regulated facility or activity on traditional land use, treaty rights, Aboriginal rights, and culturally important sites, including archeological sites.</p>   <p>In some instances during engagement, an Aboriginal group may request an additional study that falls outside of the initial scope of the regulated facility or activity. This may include traditional land use studies or archaeological assessments.</p>   <p>Licensees should document all Aboriginal engagement activities (e.g., letters, phone calls, meetings) conducted with Aboriginal groups in order to track issues and concerns raised as well as any steps taken to minimize impacts or to address issues. Any proposed mitigation measures or modifications – including any that occurred before submission of the project description and/or licence application – should be documented, in order to demonstrate how initial concerns of Aboriginal groups have been addressed and to show ongoing responsiveness.</p>
<p>Licensees should have a records management process in place to record Aboriginal engagement activities. Records management tools may include an engagement log that lists activities by date, time and individual/group, and an issues tracking table that identifies issues raised by groups and whether these have been addressed or remain outstanding.</p>  <p>Licensees  are encouraged to provide all potentially useful information on Aboriginal  engagement activities to the CNSC, including agreements with Aboriginal groups.  Note that, pursuant to the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/a-1/"><em>Access to Information Act</em></a> and the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/"><em>Privacy Act</em></a>, the CNSC is  required to release certain information when requested by interested parties. Information  provided to the CNSC that is to remain confidential must be provided to the  Commission Secretary, under separate cover from a project description or  licence application, with a request that the information be protected pursuant  to section 12(1) of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2000-211/FullText.html"><em>Canadian  Nuclear Safety Commission Rules of Procedure</em></a>.</p>  <p><strong><em>Description of planned Aboriginal engagement activities</em></strong></p>  <p>The  Aboriginal engagement plan and report should include a high-level outline of  proposed Aboriginal engagement activities. The CNSC will take licensees&#39;  planned Aboriginal engagement activities into consideration when developing its  own Aboriginal consultation activity plans.</p>  <p>The CNSC may participate in licensees&#39;  Aboriginal engagement activities, where appropriate. Joint licensee/CNSC  activities offer Aboriginal groups the opportunity to understand the regulated  facility or activity and the roles and responsibilities of licensees and the  CNSC, and to raise questions and concerns with both parties.</p>  <p><strong><em>Proposed interim status reporting schedule</em></strong>  <p>Licensees  should include a proposed schedule to provide the CNSC with an interim status  report (or reports) to update the CNSC on progress against the Aboriginal engagement  plan.</p>  <p>The  proposed reporting schedule should reflect the anticipated length of the EA  and/or licensing process, and the potential impacts to established Aboriginal  and/or treaty rights and related interests, including Aboriginal title.</p>  <p>The  interim status report should be in the form of a hard copy and/or electronic letter, signed by the  licensee&#39;s appropriate authority for Aboriginal engagement, and sent to the  appropriate CNSC point of contact.</p>

It is at the Commission&#39;s discretion to impose licence conditions to ensure  that any adverse impacts from the regulated facility or activity are avoided,  mitigated or accommodated. Furthermore, licensees may be required to continue  engaging Aboriginal groups, as appropriate.</p>  <p>Licensees may also be required to update the CNSC  about their continued Aboriginal engagement activities; e.g., the status of  mitigation and accommodation measures. Licensees should also update the CNSC on  new issues raised by Aboriginal groups with respect to an adverse impact on  potential or established Aboriginal and/or treaty rights and related interests, including Aboriginal title, which could affect future operations of the regulated  facility or activity or a future licence application. The CNSC will advise the  licensee on when and how this information is to be provided, but will use  existing processes (such as those set out in RD/GD-99.3), annual reporting,  etc.</p>  <p>Regardless of the potential for an adverse impact to  an established or potential Aboriginal and/or treaty right, continued  communication among licensees, Aboriginal groups with an interest in the regulated  facility or activity, and the CNSC can:</p>  <ul>
<li>help build long-term relationships  and trust with Aboriginal groups </li>
<li>increase understanding of the regulated  facility or activity, by sharing information on the facility&#39;s operation and  updates on follow-up and/or monitoring programs</li>

<h2 id="appA">Appendix A: Consideration for Aboriginal Engagement</h2>  <p>The following questions may guide licensees in  determining if Aboriginal engagement is appropriate, and if so, to what extent.  If the answer is &quot;yes&quot; to one or more of these questions, Aboriginal engagement  is likely appropriate. If Aboriginal engagement is determined to be  appropriate, the level of engagement should align with the strength of the  responses. These questions should be considered in conjunction with the  consultation activity spectrum (see table&nbsp;1) when determining the level of  engagement for the proposed regulated facility or activity. Conducting research  and collecting information to respond to these questions will guide licensees  in identifying potentially impacted Aboriginal groups, developing engagement  plans, and organizing Aboriginal engagement activities.</p>  <ul>
<li>Does the proposed regulated  facility or activity have likely or potential impacts on land, water and  resources? If there are any impacts, what changes to the current condition or  use of lands, water or resources are likely to occur as a result of the proposed  regulated facility or activity? Are these changes significant? </li>
<li>Does the Aboriginal group claim  traditional territory that encompasses the location of the proposed regulated  facility or activity?</li>
<li>Are there any First Nation reserve  lands or Aboriginal communities near the proposed regulated facility or  activity?</li>
<li>Are you aware of any communication  from Aboriginal groups who are raising concerns about the proposed regulated  facility or activity or similar facilities or activities in the area?</li>
<li>Are you aware of any past  grievances or issues that an Aboriginal group may have with your industry or organization?  How were these grievances addressed? </li>
<li>Have any Aboriginal groups  expressed concerns about the proposed regulated facility or activity and  suggested any remedial measures that may accommodate the adverse impacts on  their rights and/or related interests, including Aboriginal title? Having such  discussions with the relevant decision-makers as early as possible in the  consultation process will allow federal officials to discuss proposed options  appropriately with Aboriginal groups later in the process. </li>
<li>Does the proposed regulated  facility or activity involve lands or resources that are currently the subject  of land claim negotiations or are part of existing comprehensive land claim  agreements or self-government agreements? </li>
<li>Are the potential adverse impacts that  have been identified likely to be of a temporary or permanent nature? </li>
<li>Have any environmental or other  assessments of the proposed regulated facility or activity been carried out?  Have any environmental or other assessments been undertaken for similar  activities in the vicinity of the proposed regulated facility or activity? If  so, what adverse impacts on rights and/or related interests, including  Aboriginal title, are revealed, if any, by these assessments? </li>
<li>Are there any other activities  occurring in the same area? Is the proposed regulated facility or activity likely  to have any cumulative effects in combination with other activities in the same  or surrounding area?</li>
<li>Are you aware of the nature and  scope of any asserted rights and/or related interests, including Aboriginal  title, in the area? </li>
<li>Has the Aboriginal group  continually occupied the area near the regulated facility or activity? </li>
<li>Does the group still occupy the  area? If the Aboriginal group does not still occupy the area, at what period of  time did they occupy it? </li>
<li>Are there historical and/or  current traditional Aboriginal practices occurring in the area? </li>
<li>Is the Aboriginal group alleging  that the claimed rights were exercised prior to European contact (or for the  Métis, prior to effective control)? Do they continue to exercise these rights  today in a traditional or modernized form?</li>
<li>Could the status of land claims  and self-government agreements have implications with respect to the proposed regulated  facility or activity?</li>
<li>Are there any cultural activities  or events that may prevent many community members from participating in engagement  activities?</li>
<li>Is the Aboriginal group a signatory  of a historic or modern treaty?</li>
<li>Does the Aboriginal group have a  consultation protocol?</li>
<li>Has the Aboriginal group been  involved in recent litigation or landmark court cases?</li>
<li>Has the Aboriginal group been involved  in any concluded or ongoing litigation, as well as concluded or ongoing land  claims?</li>
<li>Is the Aboriginal group involved  in the negotiation for treaty land entitlements?</li>
<li>Is the Aboriginal group currently  involved in any other consultations with industry or government?</li>  </ul>

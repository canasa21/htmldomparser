<h2 className="reportHeading2">Preface</h2>  <p>To improve the level of understanding of information about proposed or licensed nuclear facilities and activities, licensees and licence applicants are required to develop and implement a public information and disclosure program. A public information and disclosure program is a regulatory requirement for licence applicants and licensed operators of Class I and Class II nuclear facilities, and uranium mines and mills for all phases of the lifecycle. This document clarifies the requirements of public information which, in turn, strengthens the public disclosure component. </p>  <p>RD-99.3 and its companion document, GD-99.3, <em>Guide to the Requirements for Public Information and Disclosure,</em> are also intended to assist CNSC staff in assessing documentation submitted as part of an application for a new CNSC licence, a licence renewal or compliance verification. </p>  <p>This document is a part of a suite of regulatory documents providing event and routine compliance monitoring reporting requirements, and the public information and disclosure requirements for nuclear facilities. Each regulatory document is accompanied by a complementary guidance document.</p>  <p>Together, RD-99.3 and GD-99.3 replace Regulatory Guide G-217, <em>Licensee Public Information Programs</em>.</p>

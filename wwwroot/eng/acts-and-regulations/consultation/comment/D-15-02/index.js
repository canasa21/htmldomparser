<h2>Preface</h2>  <p>Discussion papers play  an important role in the selection and development of the regulatory framework  and regulatory program of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC). They  are used to advise the public and stakeholders of the CNSC&#39;s intent to commence  review of a published regulation or regulatory document and to solicit early  public feedback. </p>  <p>The use of discussion  papers early in the regulatory process underlines the CNSC&#39;s commitment to a  transparent consultation process. The CNSC analyzes and considers preliminary  feedback when determining the type and nature of changes to be implemented to  its regulatory framework. </p>  <p>Discussion papers are  made available for public comment for a specified period of time. The CNSC  considers all feedback received from this consultation process in determining  its regulatory approach.</p>  <div className="col-md-12 module-table-contents">  <h2>Table of Contents</h2>  <ul>

As part of accomplishing this mandate, the CNSC is currently  reviewing the content of the following two published guidance documents:</p>  <ul>
<li>G-208, <em>Transportation  Security Programs for Category I, II or III Nuclear Material</em></li>
<li>G-274, <em>Security Programs for Category I or II Nuclear Material or Certain  Nuclear Facilities</em></li>  </ul>  <p>Both of these documents were  published in March 2003 and are due for a periodic regulatory review. After an initial  review of the documents, CNSC staff concluded that the guidance in both of them  is still largely relevant, and that only minor changes would be needed to bring  the documents up to current regulatory standards.</p>  <p>This discussion paper seeks  feedback on the material contained in G-274 and G-208 from licensees, the  Canadian public and other stakeholders. It also outlines proposed changes to the  material in G-274 and G-208 and seeks comments on these suggested modifications.  The CNSC will consider all feedback received during this consultation process  as it updates and integrates the material in these two documents into its modernized  regulatory framework.</p>  <h2 id="sec-1">1. Introduction</h2>  <p>The CNSC&#39;s  regulatory document framework refers to documents that detail its approach to  regulating the nuclear industry. This framework classifies all existing  documents and document projects according to the following categories: regulated  facilities and activities; safety and control areas; and other areas of  regulatory interest. </p>  <p>This  framework facilitates licensee and public access to all applicable CNSC  regulatory expectations. Documents in this framework are periodically reviewed,  and are reissued according to the CNSC&#39;s regulatory framework plan.</p>  <p>The CNSC  is currently reviewing the following two guidance documents in the framework:</p>  <ul>
<li>G-208, <em>Transportation Security Programs for Category I, II or III Nuclear  Material</em></li>
<li>G-274, <em>Security Programs for Category I or II Nuclear Material or Certain  Nuclear Facilities</em></li>  </ul>  <p>This paper summarizes the CNSC&#39;s proposed  changes to the guidance in G-208 and G-274. The CNSC considers these changes to  be minor, and intends to solicit feedback on the material in these two  documents as well as the proposed changes. All feedback will be considered as  the material in both documents is updated and integrated into the CNSC&#39;s  regulatory document framework.</p>  <h2 id="sec-2">2. Description of proposed changes</h2>  <h3 id="sec-2-1">2.1 G-208, <em>Transportation Security Programs for Category I, II or III Nuclear  Material</em></h3>  <h4 id="sec-2-1-1">2.1.1 Purpose of G-208</h4>  <p>Regulatory guide G-208 helps applicants  for a CNSC licence to transport Category I, II or III nuclear material prepare  and submit a written transportation security plan that meets the requirements  of section 5 of the <em>Nuclear Security  Regulations</em>.</p>  <h4 id="sec-2-1-2">2.1.2 Scope of G-208</h4>  <p>G-208 describes: </p>  <ul>
<li>the information that should  typically be included in the transportation security plan referred to above</li>
<li>the transport security measures  that should be taken into account when developing the transportation security  plan</li>
<li>how the transportation security  plan should be handled in order to meet requirements related to confidentiality  and national security</li>  </ul>  <p>Other federal requirements related  to the transport of Category I, II or III nuclear material, such as those  pertaining to packaging, documentation and safety markings, can be found in the  CNSC <em>Packaging and Transport of Nuclear  Substances Regulations</em> and Transport Canada&#39;s<em> Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations</em>.</p>  <h4 id="sec-2-1-3">2.1.3 Recommended changes to G-208</h4>  <p>CNSC staff have noted the following  on current G-208 content:</p>  <ol>
<li>While using an adequately  maintained vehicle for the transport of nuclear material is an expectation,  CNSC staff feel that guidance on the inclusion of measures to assure adequate  vehicular maintenance is outside of CNSC expertise. Therefore, it is proposed  to remove this guidance.</li>
<li>To better match industry  terminology, the term &ldquo;security monitoring room&rdquo; is being proposed for use when  referencing a transport security control centre.</li>
<li>Satellite and global  positioning systems are now capable of providing continuous tracking and  monitoring capability. Therefore, CNSC staff are proposing to add guidance on their  use.</li>
<li>To allow for flexibility as  well as electronic submissions, CNSC staff propose removing guidance on submission  type and format (e.g., size of paper, header and footer content, etc.).</li>
<li>To ensure alignment with  current CNSC regulatory document standards, it is proposed to make several  administrative changes to G-208 content, including updating CNSC contact  information, links to other documentation and general document format.</li>  </ol>  <h3 id="sec-2-2">2.2 G-274, <em>Security Programs for Category I or II Nuclear Material or Certain  Nuclear Facilities</em></h3>  <h4 id="sec-2-2-1">2.2.1 Purpose of G-274</h4>  <p>G-274 helps applicants for a CNSC  licence, in respect of Category I or II nuclear material – other than a licence  to transport – or a nuclear facility consisting of a nuclear reactor that may  exceed 10 MW thermal power during normal operation, prepare and submit the  security information to be included with the application. The submission of  this information is pursuant to the <em>Nuclear  Safety and Control Act</em>.</p>  <h4 id="sec-2-2-2">2.2.2 Scope of G-274</h4>  <p>G-274 describes:</p>  <ul>
<li>the security information that  should typically be included with the application for any licence referred to  above</li>
<li>how the security information  may be organized and presented in a separate document (hereinafter called the  security program description), to assist the CNSC in reviewing and processing  the application</li>
<li>administrative procedures to follow  when preparing, submitting or revising the security program description</li>  </ul>  <h4 id="sec-2-2-3">2.2.3 Recommended changes to G-274</h4>  <p>CNSC staff have noted the following  on current G-274 content:</p>  <ol>
<li>As a result of updates to the <em>Nuclear Security Regulations, </em>the  following items in G-274 should be updated:</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>The term &ldquo;guard&rdquo; should be replaced  with &ldquo;officer&rdquo; or &ldquo;member of nuclear response force&rdquo; as applicable.</li>
<li>The frequency of security  drills should be changed from every six months to monthly.</li>
<li>A new section called &ldquo;Vital  areas&rdquo; should be added to remind stakeholder to include a description of  proposed measures to meet requirements in a licence application.</li>
<li>A new section called &ldquo;Supervisory  awareness program&rdquo; should be added, asking that a licence application include a  description of the proposed measures to instruct all supervisors to recognize  behavioral changes in a licence application.</li>
</ol>
<li>Regulatory document RD-363, <em>Nuclear Security Officer Medical, Physical,  and Psychological Fitness</em>, has been published since the last revision of  G-274. Therefore, G-274 should be updated with a new section called &ldquo;Fitness of  nuclear security officers&rdquo;, reminding licensees to include a description of the  proposed plan for fitness testing in accordance with RD-363, as part of the  security information of their licence application.</li>
<li>As technology has changed, a  description of secure communication for nuclear response forces, including  secure radio communications and secure backup communication, should be included.</li>
<li>To allow for flexibility as  well as electronic submissions, CNSC staff propose removing guidance on  submission type and format (e.g., size of paper, header and footer content, etc.).</li>
<li>To ensure alignment with  current CNSC regulatory document standards, it is proposed to make several  administrative changes to G-208 content, including updating CNSC contact  information, links to other documentation and general document format.</li>  </ol>  <h2 id="sec-3">3. Conclusion</h2>  <p>In their initial  review of the documents, CNSC staff concluded that the guidance in G-208 and G-274  is still largely relevant, and that only minor changes would be needed to bring  the documents up to current regulatory standards. </p>  <h2 id="sec-4">4. Public input</h2>  <p>The CNSC welcomes feedback on G-208  and G-274, along with the proposed changes to content outlined in this discussion  paper.</p>  <p>The CNSC expects that this proposal  would result in minimal overall change to licensees&#39; current levels of  administrative and operational burden.</p>  <p>Feedback received will help inform the CNSC while updating the content of both documents to be included in the 2.12 - Security  series of its regulatory framework. </p>  <h2 id="sec-5">5.

<h2 className="reportHeading2">Preface</h2>  <p>This document details the information that nuclear power plant (NPP) licensees are to report to the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) to support the conditions of applicable operating licences. The document gives the types of compliance monitoring reports, the frequency, and the applicable timeframe for reporting (reporting timeframes are determined by the safety significance of the event). </p>  <p>This document replaces S-99, <em>Reporting Requirements for Operating Nuclear Power Plants</em>, published in March 2003. </p>  <p>This document has a companion guidance document entitled GD-99.2, <em>Guide to the Reporting Requirements for Operating Nuclear Power Plants: Compliance Monitoring. </em>GD-99.2 contains guidance, explanatory information, forms and templates provided by the CNSC to assist users in meeting the requirements of RD-99.2. </p>  <p>This document is a part of a suite of regulatory documents providing event and routine compliance monitoring reporting requirements, and the public information and disclosure requirements for nuclear facilities. Each regulatory document is accompanied by a complementary guidance document.</p>  <p>Key principles and elements used in developing this document are consistent with national and international standards. The complete list of standards is included in the <em>Additional Information</em> section.</p>  <p>Nothing contained in this document shall be construed as relieving any licensee from pertinent requirements. It is the licensee&#8217;s responsibility to identify and comply with all applicable regulations and licence conditions.</p>

<dd>Uncontrolled combustion, not restricted to open flame, that causes personal injury, death or property damage, or results in the mobilization of the emergency response team where mitigation action was needed to extinguish the combustion.</dd>
<dt>flooding</dt>
<dd>Liquid present in an area in a quantity exceeding what would normally be expected and has an impact on the safe operation of the NPP. </dd>
<dt>human factors</dt>
<dd>Factors that influence human performance as it relates to the safety of a nuclear facility or activity over all phases, including design, operation, maintenance and decommissioning. Factors may include the characteristics of the person, task, equipment, organization, environment and training.</dd>
<dt>impairment&nbsp;</dt>
<dd>A failure such that the safety-related system would operate with reduced redundancy or margin of safety, or would fail to meet its design intent. Level 1 impairment is used to describe a system state that is impaired to the extent that it would provide inadequate protection. Level 2 impairment is used to describe a system state that is impaired to the extent that it would provide some, but not complete, protection for a worst-case process failure. Level 3 impairment is used to describe a system state where the level of redundancy or margin of safety is reduced but the system is still fully capable of meeting its design intent. </dd>
<dt>initiating event </dt>
<dd>An event that initiates a sequence of events that could lead to a severe accident in the absence of action by a system important to safety, or an event involving a system important to safety that initiates a sequence of events that could have led to a severe accident if other systems important to safety had not acted.</dd>
<dt>licensing document </dt>
<dd>A document listed or referred to in a licence issued by the CNSC.</dd>
<dt>nuclear power plant </dt>
<dd>A fission-reactor installation that has been constructed to generate electricity on a commercial scale (an NPP is a Class IA nuclear facility, as defined in the <em>Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations</em>).</dd>
<dt>pressure boundary </dt>
<dd>A boundary of a pressure-retaining vessel, structure, system or component of a nuclear or non-nuclear system, where the vessel, structure, system or component is registered (or eligible for registration) under boiler or pressure vessel legislation or is part of the NPP containment system. </dd>
<dt>pressure boundary degradation</dt>
<dd>A degradation of a pressure boundary that exceeds any relevant limit specified in the applicable design analysis, design codes or standards, or inspection codes or standards.</dd>

<dd>The ability of a system, structure or component to perform, in accordance with its defined specifications, its required function under given conditions for a defined time period or upon demand.</dd>
<dt>safety analysis</dt>
<dd>Evaluation of the potential hazards associated with the conduct of a proposed activity. Safety analysis involves deterministic and probabilistic analyses in support of the siting, design, commissioning, operation or decommissioning of an NPP.</dd>
<dt>safety-related system</dt>
<dd>As defined in the Canadian Standards Association publication CSA-N285.0-08, <em>General requirements for pressure-retaining systems and components in CANDU nuclear power plants</em>,<em> </em>that is referenced in the nuclear power plant licence.</dd>
<dt>safety significance</dt>
<dd>Refers to the significance of a discovery or issue with respect to the impact on meeting the fundamental nuclear safety objectives as defined by the IAEA. In general, a discovery or event has safety significance if it denotes a deviation away from the safety case accepted in the licence in the direction detrimental to safety, such as: </dd>  </dl>  <ul>
<li>reducing margins to, or exceeding the accepted limits </li>
<li>increasing risk </li>
<li>impairments (various degrees) of the special safety systems or of the safety functions for accident mitigation </li>

<li>events causing radioactive releases and spills of hazardous substances, injuries to workers or public, etc.</li>  </ul>  <dl className="margins-removed">
<dt>special safety system</dt>
<dd>One of the following systems of an NPP: shutdown system no.1, the shutdown system no. 2, the containment system or the emergency core cooling system.</dd>
<dt>systems important to safety </dt>
<dd>Structures, systems and components of the NPP associated with the initiation, prevention, detection or mitigation of any failure sequence that have the most significant impact in reducing the possibility of&nbsp;damage&nbsp;to fuel or associated release of radionuclide, or both.</dd>  </dl>

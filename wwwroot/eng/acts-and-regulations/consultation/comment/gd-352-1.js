<h2 className="reportHeading2">Preface</h2>  <p>Industrial radiography is an activity that is regulated mainly by the <em>Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices Regulations</em> (NSRD Regulations). Industrial radiography is a non-destructive testing method that uses high activity sealed radioactive sources to examine the structure of welds, castings and building components, in order to identify flaws and errors, or to ensure that work in an area will not impact hidden existing systems such as pipes and electrical wires. The advantages of using an exposure device for non-destructive testing are that it is highly portable, requires no external power sources, and can be used in a variety of field settings.</p>  <p>The widespread use of sealed radioactive sources, along with their potential to immediately deliver high doses of radiation, means that industrial radiography is recognized by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission and the international community as a high risk activity. </p>  <p>The NSRD Regulations require that exposure devices, which include related accessories and any other radiation device, be certified by the CNSC before they can be used in Canada. This certification is not to be construed as a licence for use or servicing. The equipment used for industrial radiography must be certified by the CNSC before it can be licensed by the CNSC for use in Canada.</p>  <p>This document provides guidance in the design, testing and performance of exposure devices, in order to apply for the certification of the radiation device under section 12 of the NSRD Regulations. Persons applying for certification of such devices must thoroughly demonstrate that the exposure device and related accessories are designed to operate in a safe manner. </p>  <p>This document does not deal with the labelling or transport of the exposure devices, or the certification of exposure device operators and their obligations when using exposure devices. Labelling and signage requirements for exposure devices and source holders are set out in the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em> and the NSRD Regulations. Transport requirements are set out in the <em>Packaging and Transport of Nuclear Substances Regulations</em>. These regulations require that some exposure devices also be certified as Type B(U) transport packages. Certification of exposure device operators and their obligations when operating the device are set out in the NSRD Regulations.</p>  <p>RD/GD-352 largely refers to the established International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard, <em>Radiation protection &#8211; Apparatus for industrial gamma radiography &#8211; Specifications for performance, design and tests</em>, ISO 3999:2004 (E) [<a href="#R1">1</a>].</p>  <p>Nothing contained in this document is to be construed as relieving any applicant from the requirements of any pertinent regulations. It is the applicant&#8217;s responsibility to identify and comply with all applicable legislation and standards.</p>

<h3 className="reportHeading3"><a name="P94_7278" id="P94_7278"></a>1.4 National and international standards</h3>  <p>The review of an application for certification of an exposure device is based on the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard ISO 3999:2004, <em>Radiation protection &#8211; Apparatus for industrial gamma radiography &#8211; Specifications for performance, design and tests</em> [<a href="#R1">1</a>]. Throughout this document, all references to the ISO standard mean ISO 3999:2004.</p>  <p>Nothing contained in this document is to be construed as relieving any applicant from the requirements of any pertinent regulations. It is the applicant&#8217;s responsibility to identify and comply with all applicable legislation and standards.</p>
<a name="2.0"></a>
<h2 className="reportHeading2"><a name="P97_7927" id="P97_7927"></a>2.0 Application Review Criteria</h2>  <p>In order to assess an application for the certification of an exposure device design, this section describes the type of information that the CNSC requires, which is different from the requirements outlined in ISO 3999:2004. </p>
<a name="2.1"></a>
<h3 className="reportHeading3"><a name="P99_8183" id="P99_8183"></a>2.1 Explanation of terms</h3>  <p>The following terms apply throughout this document:</p>  <ol>
<li> ISO standard means the International Standard ISO 3999:2004;</li>
<li> Where applicable, the common industry term is given (in brackets);</li>
<li> The term &#8220;apparatus for industrial gamma radiography&#8221; is described in the above ISO standard. However, in this document it is replaced by the term &#8220;exposure device,&#8221; as defined in the NSRD Regulations;</li>
<li> An accessory to an exposure device is considered to be any equipment used in conjunction with an exposure container and that drives, guides, or comes into contact with the sealed source assembly. </li>  </ol>  <blockquote>
<p>Accessories to the device include: </p>  </blockquote>  <ol>
<ol className="lower-alpha">

<li>Remote control &#8211; which includes the control cable sheath, control cable connector, control adaptor and the control mechanism;</li>
<li> Projection sheath (guide tube);</li>
<li> Exposure head (source stop);</li>
<li>Beam limiter (collimator) - when designed as an integral part of an exposure head;<em><br />
Note:</em> Beam limiters designed to be secured over the exposure head are not considered an accessory to the device and therefore do not require certification.</li>
<li> Motor assembly for power-operated exposure devices; </li>
<li> Source changer.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<a name="2.2"></a>
<h3 className="reportHeading3"><a name="P113_9369" id="P113_9369"></a>2.2 Baseline specifications in the ISO standard</h3>  <p>The design of the exposure device should be in accordance with the As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) principle. The application should describe the design options for the exposure device, as well as the results of the ALARA evaluation of these design options, leading to the selection of the design submitted for certification. The application should include an evaluation of the estimated radiation doses associated with the final design, and the key factors determining its choice.</p>
<a name="2.3"></a>
<h3 className="reportHeading3"><a name="P115_9905" id="P115_9905"></a>2.3 Changes to ISO standard requirements</h3>  <p>The following recommendations supplement sub-clauses in ISO 3999:2004, in order to meet CNSC requirements.</p>
<a name="2.3.1"></a>
<h4 className="reportHeading4"><em><a name="P117_10051" id="P117_10051"></a></em>2.3.1 General design</h4>  <p>ISO 3999:2004 requires the design of the exposure device to operate over the temperature range of -10<sup>o</sup>C to 45<sup>o</sup>C. However, in order to meet the demands of the Canadian climate, the device should operate satisfactorily over the broader temperature range of&nbsp;-40&ordm;C to 45&ordm;C.</p>
<a name="2.3.2"></a>
<h4 className="reportHeading4"><em><a name="P119_10344" id="P119_10344"></a></em>2.3.2 Sealed sources</h4>  <p>ISO 3999:2004 requires that the radioactive sealed source be in compliance with ISO&nbsp;2919:1999 [<a href="#R2">2</a>]. Compliance with ANSI N43.6-1997 [<a href="#R3">3</a>] is also acceptable for radiation device certification by the CNSC.</p>
<a name="2.3.3"></a>
<h4 className="reportHeading4"><em><a name="P121_10566" id="P121_10566"></a></em>2.3.3 Safety devices: Operation of the automatic securing mechanism </h4>  <p>The ISO standard does not address exposure devices that employ a shutter for shielding the sealed source assembly in the secured position. In such cases, the shutter should have a securing mechanism that automatically secures it in the shielded position each time the sealed source assembly is returned from the exposing position to the fully shielded position. It should be possible to release the shutter only by means of an intentional operation on the exposure device or the remote control.</p>  <p>The securing mechanism should not operate in a manner that prevents the source from returning to the shielded position. </p>
<a name="2.3.4"></a>
<h4 className="reportHeading4"><em><a name="P124_11249" id="P124_11249"></a></em>2.3.4 Remote control security </h4>  <p>If the control mechanism incorporates a device to indicate the travel distance of the control cable, there should be a means for adjusting the &#8220;zero&#8221; position.</p>  <p>ISO 3999:2004 does not address remote controls that operate using hydraulic, pneumatic, or vacuum systems. In these cases, there should be a means of determining any leaks in the remote control system.</p>
<a name="2.3.5"></a>
<h4 className="reportHeading4"><em><a name="P127_11643" id="P127_11643"></a></em>2.3.5 Resistance to normal conditions of service</h4>  <p><em><strong>2.3.5.1 General</strong></em></p>  <p>Unless the exposure device and its accessories have already passed identical tests or more stringent tests under other standards, they should be subjected to the tests described in ISO 3999:2004. Production exposure devices should be equivalent to the tested unit.</p>  <p>The reference to IAEA-STI-PUB 998 should be replaced with the IAEA regulations TS-R-1, <em>Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material</em>, 1996 Edition (Revised) [<a href="#R4">4</a>], and IAEA Safety Standard Series No. ST-2, <em>Advisory Material for the IAEA Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material Safety Guide </em>[<a href="#R5">5</a>]. </p>  <p><strong><em>2.3.5.2 Endurance test</em></strong></p>  <p>The exposure device should operate normally and the integrity of the cladding or encasement of the shielding should not be breached due to wear at the conclusion of the endurance test. The use of a borescope, or an equivalent test, should be performed to check any fatigue or wear of the S-tube.</p>
<a name="2.3.6"></a>
<h4 className="reportHeading4"><em><a name="P133_12613" id="P133_12613"></a></em>2.3.6 Vibration-resistance test</h4>  <p>Either the vibration test described in sub-clause 6.4.5 of ISO 3999:2004 or that described in section 6.2.2 of the ANSI N43.9-1991 standard [<a href="#R6">6</a>] may be used.</p>
<a name="2.3.7"></a>
<h4 className="reportHeading4"><em><a name="P135_12800" id="P135_12800"></a></em>2.3.7 Labelling</h4>  <p>Subsection 20(1) of the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em> must be followed regarding the labelling of exposure containers and devices. They must be labelled with the basic ionizing radiation symbol (see schedule 3 of the regulations) and the words &#8220;RAYONNEMENT &#8211; DANGER &#8211; RADIATION&#8221;. The critical components of associated equipment, except the control cable, must be durably and legibly marked to identify the manufacturer.</p>
<a name="2.3.8"></a>
<h4 className="reportHeading4"><em><a name="P137_13245" id="P137_13245"></a></em>2.3.8 Accompanying documents: Instructions for use</h4>  <p>In addition to the list in sub-clause 9.3 of the ISO standard, instructions on the conditions and limitation of use should also be provided, including environmental conditions (such as temperature, pressure, and humidity), chemical environment, and underwater restrictions.</p>
<a name="2.4"></a>
<h3 className="reportHeading3"><a name="P139_13571" id="P139_13571"></a>2.4 Specifications not addressed in the ISO standard</h3>  <p>The following recommendations are in addition to the ISO standard.</p>
<a name="2.4.1"></a>
<h4 className="reportHeading4"><em><a name="P141_13689" id="P141_13689"></a></em>2.4.1 Source changer</h4>  <p>Source changers should be equipped with a locking mechanism designed to prevent the inadvertent release of the source while transferring source assemblies to and from the exposure container. The lock should also prevent any unauthorised or accidental removal of the sealed source from its shielded position.</p>
<a name="2.4.2"></a>
<h4 className="reportHeading4"><em><a name="P143_14016" id="P143_14016"></a></em>2.4.2 Projection sheath</h4>  <p>The projection sheath (guide tube) should be equipped with an exposure head, or be designed for an exposure head to be attached. This should prevent the sealed source assembly from passing out the end of the projection sheath. <em><br />
Note</em>: A beam limiter (collimator) may serve as an exposure head.</p>
<a name="2.5"></a>
<h3 className="reportHeading3"><a name="P145_14330" id="P145_14330"></a>2.5 Use of non-original accessory equipment</h3>  <p>Accessory equipment or components from a non-original equipment manufacturer may be used, provided that the accessory equipment or components meet the following criteria and have been certified by the CNSC:</p>  <ol>
<li>They are identical in size, material specifications, and dimensions as the prototype that has been tested according to ISO 3999:2004; and</li>
<li> They are constructed to the quality assurance requirements as specified in ISO&nbsp;3999:2004; or </li>
<li> It is demonstrated through documented prototype testing or analytical means that the non-original accessories or components meet the design, testing, and performance specifications of ISO 3999:2004.</li>  </ol>  <p>Instead of certifying individual components, the CNSC would only certify the complete accessory equipment as one unit for a specific exposure container.</p>
<a name="3.0"></a>
<h2 className="reportHeading2"><a name="P151_15169" id="P151_15169"></a>3.0 Certification of an Exposure Device Design </h2>  <p>Once a certificate for an exposure device design has been issued, it only applies to a specific exposure container model design as well as to specific operating conditions and accessories. Any future changes to the design or use may require a new certification of the radiation device.</p>

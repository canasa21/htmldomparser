<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>This regulatory document&nbsp;is part of the CNSC&rsquo;s  Human Performance Management series of  regulatory documents, which covers human factors, personnel training and  personnel certification. The full&nbsp;list of regulatory document  series&nbsp;is included at the end of this document and can also be found on  the CNSC&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/acts-and-regulations/regulatory-documents/index">nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/acts-and-regulations/regulatory-documents</a>.</p>
<p>Regulatory document REGDOC-2.2.4, <em>Fitness for Duty: Managing Worker Fatigue</em>,  sets out requirements and guidance of the CNSC with respect to managing worker fatigue  for workers at high security sites, as defined in the <em>Nuclear Security Regulations</em>. For the purpose of this regulatory  document, nuclear safety encompasses security.</p>
<p>This  document is intended to form part of the licensing basis for a regulated  facility or for a regulated activity, either as part of the conditions and  safety and control measures in a licence, or as part of the safety and control  measures to be described in a licence application and the documents needed to  support that application.</p>
<p>For  proposed new facilities, this document will be used to assess new licence  applications. For existing facilities, the requirements contained in this  document do not apply unless they have been included, in whole or in part, in  the licence or licensing basis.</p>
<p>Guidance  contained in this document provides information on how requirements may be met.  Licensees and applicants are expected to review and consider guidance; should  they choose not to follow it, they should explain how their chosen alternate  approach meets regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>The CNSC&rsquo;s regulatory framework provides an  interlinked set of regulatory requirements for the management of nuclear  facilities and activities. The management system established in the licensing  basis for a regulated facility or activity provides an overall management  framework and direction to develop and implement sound management practices and  controls for the licensing basis. This regulatory document does not duplicate  generic management system requirements. However, it provides more specific  direction for those requirements as they apply to managing worker fatigue.</p>
<p>A graded approach, commensurate with risk, may be  defined and used when applying the requirements and guidance contained in this  regulatory document. The use of a graded approach is not a relaxation of  requirements. With a graded approach, the application of requirements is  commensurate with the risks and particular characteristics of the facility or  activity.</p>

<h2 id="sec1">1. Introduction</h2>   <p>Human performance is a key contributor to the safety  and security of nuclear facilities, so the CNSC requires licensees to implement  and maintain human performance programs. These programs address a broad range  of factors that affect human performance, with the aim of minimizing the  potential for errors that could affect nuclear safety and security. One of  these factors is a worker&rsquo;s fitness for duty.</p>   <p>Fatigue is widely recognized to affect fitness for  duty because of its potential to degrade several aspects of human performance.  Therefore, licensees must address fatigue as part of their approach to ensure  that workers are fit for duty.</p>

<h2 id="sec2">2. Background</h2>   <p>Worker fatigue is a state of reduced mental or physical  performance capability resulting from sleep loss, extended wakefulness, phase  of the circadian rhythm or workload. As fatigue increases, declines occur in many  aspects of human performance, especially alertness. Alertness is fundamental to  many cognitive tasks. Recovery from fatigue, particularly the recovery of  cognitive function, requires sufficient sleep.</p>   <p>Work schedules are an important factor when managing fatigue  since they set the boundaries for the timing and duration of sleep. Key aspects  of a work schedule that affect fatigue are night work, extended shifts, the  number of consecutive shifts, and time off between blocks of shifts.</p>   <p>Even when complying with limits on hours of  work, a worker may be fatigued. Since factors at work and outside of work affect  fatigue, workers share responsibility with the employer for managing fatigue. Programmatic requirements and guidance in this  document address a broad range of elements necessary for managing  fatigue-related risks.</p>

<ul>
<li>the minimum recovery period  following a block of two night shifts may be reduced to 24 hours when a worker  is transitioning to a sequence of classroom training on days</li>
<li>to maintain minimum staff  complement, the requirement for 72 hours off following a block of 3 or more  12-hour night shifts may be reduced to 48 hours off once every three months per  worker</li>
<li>recovery periods following a block  of consecutive shifts may be reduced occasionally to enable night shift workers  to attend important meetings during the day.</li> 	</ul>   </li> </ul>

<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>This regulatory document is part of the CNSC&#39;s Environmental Protection series of regulatory documents. The full list of regulatory document series is included at the end of this document and can also be found on the CNSC&#39;s website at <a href="/eng/acts-and-regulations/regulatory-documents/index">nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/acts-and-regulations/regulatory-documents</a></p>
<p>The CNSC regulates the development, production and use of nuclear energy and the production, possession and use of nuclear substances, prescribed equipment and prescribed information. This is done in a manner consistent with Canadian environmental policies, acts and regulations, and with Canada&#39;s international  obligations, in order to protect the health, safety and security of Canadians and  the environment.</p>
<p>This part of regulatory document REGDOC-2.9.1, <em>Environmental Assessments</em>, describes the conduct of environmental assessments (EAs)  under the <em>Nuclear Safety and Control Act</em> (NSCA) and under the <em>Canadian  Environmental Assessment Act, 2012</em> (CEAA 2012).</p>
<p>The CNSC  considers an EA under the NSCA to be an assessment of information required  under the NSCA and its regulations to make a determination if the applicant  will, in carrying out an activity, make adequate provisions for the protection  of the environment and the health and safety of persons. The EA under the NSCA  is a component of the CNSC licensing process and is carried out as part of the  CNSC&#39;s review of all licence applications. No decision is  rendered on the EA itself, as the information is intended to support the  regulatory decision being sought under the NSCA.</p>
<p>In May 2013, the Commission supported making the CNSC&#39;s regulatory process more transparent, specifically with regard to the conduct of EAs under the NSCA. To improve transparency in the EA under the NSCA, the CNSC will document the EA findings based on the information that applicants must submit to meet the appropriate regulatory requirements (with a focus on radiation and environmental protection). As appropriate, the CNSC will also provide an earlier opportunity for Aboriginal and public  involvement in the licensing process. The CNSC&#39;s licensing process ensures that  applicants meet all regulatory requirements before the Commission considers a  regulatory decision.</p>
<p>As regulatory  requirements extend beyond environmental protection, the CNSC will determine, in accordance with this regulatory document, the scope and depth of EA documentation provided to Aboriginal groups and the public, and the appropriate participation opportunities. Part A of this document describes the EA conducted  under the NSCA.</p>
<p>In addition to regulatory requirements under the NSCA for environmental protection, the Commission must also meet the requirements of the CEAA 2012 for designated projects. On July 6, 2012, the CEAA 2012 came into force as part of the Government of Canada&#39;s Responsible Resource Development plan. In accordance  with the CEAA 2012, the CNSC is now the sole federal responsible authority for  conducting EAs for designated projects regulated under the NSCA and described  in the <em>Regulations Designating Physical Activities</em>. Therefore, before considering a  regulatory decision under the NSCA, the Commission must decide if the proposed project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects.</p>
<p>The CNSC supported revisions to the CEAA 2012 on the basis that it has extensive experience conducting EAs under the former CEAA (S.C. 1992, c.37), and that EAs  are conducted under the NSCA for projects not designated under the CEAA 2012. Since 2000, under the former CEAA, the CNSC rendered decisions on all screenings (approximately 57), and conducted two review panels and five comprehensive studies. The CEAA  2012 does not lessen the CNSC&#39;s environmental assessment or protection mandate, but rather recognizes its existing robust regulatory framework for environmental protection along with its ability and capacity to conduct EAs.</p>
<p>For designated projects, in addition to the NSCA&#39;s requirements, applicants are also responsible for meeting requirements under the CEAA 2012. Much of the information required for an EA under the CEAA 2012 is also required under the NSCA and its regulations. Part B of this document describes the EA process adopted by the CNSC to meet the requirements of the CEAA 2012.</p>
<p>To support its legislative mandate, the CNSC will conduct EAs in accordance with the processes outlined in this regulatory document. The information gathered during EAs helps the Commission determine if an applicant will adequately provide for the protection of the environment and the health and safety of persons. Regardless of the requirement for an EA under the CEAA 2012, the applicant must meet applicable regulatory requirements under the NSCA for the protection of the environment and the health and safety of persons.</p>
<p>Technical requirements and guidance for conducting EAs are being developed. They will be made  available to all interested parties for review and comment before they are  incorporated into the next revision of this document. This regulatory document complements  several other regulatory documents that are currently under development concerning  Aboriginal engagement, site suitability for new nuclear reactors, and the CNSC  licensing process and requirements.</p>

<h3 id="sec2" className="mrgn-tp-0">2. Background</h3>
<p>Protecting the  environment is part of the mandate of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission  (CNSC).</p>
<p>The CNSC  regulates the development, production and use of nuclear energy in Canada, as  well as the production, possession, use and transport of nuclear substances,  prescribed equipment and prescribed information. The CNSC requires that the environmental  effects of all regulated activities are evaluated and taken into account when  licensing decisions are made. The CNSC considers an EA to be an assessment of  information required under the NSCA and its regulations to make a determination  if the applicant will, in carrying out an activity, make adequate provisions  for the protection of the environment, and the health and safety of persons. This  is done in a manner consistent with all Canadian environmental policies, acts  and regulations and with Canada&#39;s international obligations.</p>
<p>In May 2013, the Commission supported improving the transparency of the CNSC&#39;s regulatory process, specifically with respect to the conduct of EAs under the NSCA. In order to improve transparency of EAs under the NSCA, the CNSC will document EA findings based on the information that applicants must submit to meet the appropriate regulatory requirements (with a focus on radiation and environmental protection). As appropriate, the CNSC will also provide earlier opportunities for Aboriginal and public involvement in the licensing process.</p>
<p>The EA under  the NSCA is a component of the CNSC licensing process (see Appendix A) and is  carried out as part of the CNSC&#39;s review of all licence applications. Improving  transparency will help facilitate the identification of Aboriginal and public  issues earlier in the licensing process, and will inform interested parties and  the Commission, or a designated officer (DO), as the case may be, of a project&#39;s  potential environmental effects. No decision will be  rendered on the EA itself, as the information is intended to support regulatory  decision-making under the NSCA.</p>
<p>The CNSC licensing process ensures that applicants meet all regulatory requirements before a regulatory decision is considered.</p>

<h4 id="sec2-1" className="mrgn-tp-0">2.1 Relevant legislation</h4>
<p>The NSCA prohibits the Commission from issuing, renewing, amending, transferring or  replacing a licence unless, in the opinion of the Commission, the applicant is  qualified to carry out the activity that the licence will authorize; and will,  in carrying out that activity, make adequate provision for the protection of  the environment, the health and safety of persons and the maintenance of  national security and measures required to implement international obligations  to which Canada has agreed. Furthermore, the NSCA provides that a licence  issued by the CNSC may contain any term or condition that the Commission  considers necessary for the purposes of the Act.</p>
<p>The  requirements for an appropriate consideration or assessment of human health and  environmental effects (e.g., environmental risk assessment) for all  nuclear-related activities regulated by the CNSC are provided for in regulations  made under the NSCA. These regulations include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations</em></li>
<li><em>Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations</em></li>
<li><em>Uranium Mines and Mills Regulations</em></li>
<li><em>Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed  Equipment Regulations</em></li>
<li><em>Packaging and Transport of Nuclear Substances  Regulations</em></li>
<li><em>Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices  Regulations</em></li>
<li><em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em></li>
</ul>
<p>An  applicant is responsible for meeting the applicable requirements of the NSCA  and its regulations. The CNSC conducts a technical review of all licence  applications and supporting technical submissions to ensure adequate provision will  be made for the protection of the environment and the health and safety of  persons. During the technical review, the CNSC ensures the applicant  appropriately considers relevant standards and policies, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSA N288.1,<em> Guidelines</em> <em>for Calculating Derived  Release Limits for Radioactive Material in Airborne and Liquid Effluents for  Normal Operation of Nuclear Facilities</em>, 2008</li>
<li>CSA N288.4, <em>Environmental  Monitoring Programs at Class I Nuclear Facilities and Uranium Mines and Mills</em>,  2010</li>
<li>CSA N288.5, <em>Effluent  Monitoring Program at Class I Nuclear Facilities and Uranium Mines and Mills, </em>2011</li>
<li>CSA N288.6 , <em>Environmental  Risk Assessment at Class I Nuclear Facilities and Uranium Mines and Mills</em>,  2012</li>
<li>CAN/ISO 14001, <em>Environmental Management Systems â€“ Requirements with Guidance for Use</em>,  2004</li>
<li>REGDOC-2.9.1, <em>Environmental Protection: Policies, Programs and Procedures at Class I  Nuclear Facilities and Uranium Mines and Mills</em>, 2013</li>
<li>CNSC P-223, <em>Protecting the Environment,</em> 2001</li>
</ul>
<p>The applicant  is responsible for addressing all issues identified by the CNSC before a recommendation  for a regulatory decision is presented to the Commission or a DO. <br />
The  CNSC ensures that regulatory requirements are met and maintained through the  CNSC compliance process. More information on compliance verification and  enforcement activities is on the <a href="http://www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/acts-and-regulations/compliance-verification-and-enforcement/index">CNSC Web site</a></p>

<p>The CNSC recognizes that applicants  may begin to determine the feasibility of a project well before submitting a  licence application. Early communication with the CNSC is recommended, to help  applicants:</p>
<ul>
<li>understand the regulatory requirements</li>
<li>determine the scope of any technical support  studies required</li>
<li>understand the CNSC&#39;s licensing  (including EA) process </li>

<h4 id="sec3-3" className="mrgn-tp-0">Step 3: Determination of participation opportunities</h4>
<p>Aboriginal and public participation opportunities are determined on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>As an EA is integrated within the licensing process, the following opportunities may be provided to support the licensing process:</p>
<ul>
<li>opportunity to review and comment during the CNSC technical review of the applicant&#39;s EA-related documentation contained in the licence application (step 7.1)</li>
<li>opportunity to review and comment on the EA Conclusion Report (step 8.1)</li>
</ul>
<p>The CNSC may also determine other activities, such as open houses and workshops, to be appropriate. These EA participation opportunities may be provided in addition to those provided during the licensing process (e.g., intervening in the hearing). The CNSC will post a notice on the CNSC Web site and distribute the notice to the CNSC subscription list before participation opportunities are conducted.</p>
<p>As assessment of the EA criteria, described in Appendix B, may be completed to support the determination of participation opportunities.</p>
<p>The availability of the CNSC&#39;s Participant Funding Program to help facilitate public and Aboriginal groups&#39; involvement  in an EA shall be determined on a case-by-case basis (e.g., review of EA-related  documentation).

<p>The CNSC will provide project-specific guidance concerning the regulatory requirements, as appropriate, or upon request. The scope of the  technical studies required for the EA process will generally be based upon the  information that is required in the license application to meet the  requirements of the NSCA and its regulations.</p>
<p>The CNSC also has the authority, in accordance with paragraph 3(1)(m) of the <em>General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations</em>,to require additional information to enable the Commission to determine  whether adequate provision will be made for the protection of the environment and the health and safety of persons. Additional information may include such factors as a consideration of cumulative effects or alternative means to carry out the project.</p>
<p>To ensure the applicant understands all appropriate EA requirements, the applicant is encouraged to seek CNSC guidance at the earliest possible stage of the licensing process (e.g., step 1).</p>

<h4 id="sec3-7" className="mrgn-tp-0">Step 7: Technical review of applicant submissions</h4>
<p>During this stage, the CNSC will review the licence application and any supporting EA technical studies to ensure that the application meets all EA requirements. The scope and duration of the technical review will vary, depending on the type of regulatory decision being sought.</p>
<p>The applicant is responsible for addressing all issues identified by the CNSC.</p>
<h5 id="sec3-7-1">Step 7.1: External review of EA-related submissions</h5>
<p>If Aboriginal groups and the public are to be provided an opportunity to review EA-related  documentation (determined in step 3), a notice will be posted on the CNSC Web site and distributed to the CNSC subscription list. Where applicable, identified Aboriginal groups will be sent the relevant documents and informed of the timelines and process to submit comments. The review by Aboriginal groups and the public will occur concurrently with the CNSC technical review.</p>
<p>External review may also involve other federal, provincial or territorial departments as appropriate.</p>
<p>The applicant will address concerns raised during the external review period, if needed and as determined by the CNSC.</p>

<h4 id="sec3-8" className="mrgn-tp-0">Step 8: Document the EA findings</h4>
<p>The EA findings will be represented in the licensing Commission Member Document (CMD) by an EA conclusion summary. The EA conclusion summary is based on the applicant&#39;s licence application and any supporting EA technical studies; and the results of the technical review, including the external review as appropriate.</p>
<p>For more complex projects, the CNSC may prepare an EA Conclusion Report, documenting the EA findings in more detail. This report would be appended to the licensing CMD. The need for and scope of the EA Conclusion Report is determined by the CNSC, based on, but not limited to, the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regulatory requirements</li>
<li>Previous EAs</li>
<li>Potential environmental effects and interactions</li>
<li>Aboriginal and public interests, concerns and knowledge </li>
</ul>
<p>The EA criteria, described in Appendix B, may also be evaluated to support the determination of the need for and scope of the EA Conclusion Report.</p>
<p>Proposed projects that would likely include an EA Conclusion Report are: uranium mining and milling production increases, major facility expansions, power plant refurbishments, and major site remediation.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Commission or DO may also determine the scope and level of EA documentation for a specific licence application.</p>
<h5 id="sec3-8-1">Step 8.1: External review of EA conclusion report</h5>
<p>If Aboriginal groups and the public are to be provided an opportunity to review the EA Conclusion Report, a notice will be posted on the CNSC Web site (determined in step 3), forwarded to identified Aboriginal groups, where appropriate, and distributed to the CNSC subscription list, in addition to any other project-specific consultation activities.</p>
<p>The CNSC may require applicants to address concerns raised during the external review period, if needed and as determined by the CNSC.</p>

<p>CNSC staff recommendations related to a licence application, certificate or approval are reviewed and decided upon by the Commission or a DO.</p>
<p>The EA findings will be documented in CNSC staff&#39;s recommendations (e.g., CMD), along with any proposed modifications to the applicant&#39;s relevant policies, programs or procedures, or measures that will be taken to prevent or mitigate effects on the environment and the health and safety of persons. No decision will be rendered on the EA documentation itself, as the information is intended to inform the regulatory decision being  sought under the NSCA.</p>
<p>Following a hearing, a decision is rendered by the Commission. The nature of the hearing will be determined on a case-by-case basis, and may take into account the views, concerns and opinions of interested parties (e.g., through written or oral interventions).

<h3 id="sec5" className="mrgn-tp-0">5. Background</h3>
<p>The CEAA 2012 came into force on  July 6, 2012, and is the legal basis for the federal EA process in Canada.</p>
<p>In accordance with paragraph 15(a)  of the CEAA 2012, the CNSC is the sole federal responsible authority (RA) for  conducting an EA for designated projects regulated under the NSCA and described  in the <em><a href="http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2012/2012-07-18/html/sor-dors147-eng.html">Regulations Designating Physical Activities</a></em> (e.g., new uranium mine or mill, new nuclear power plant) made pursuant to subparagraph 84(a)(i) of the CEAA 2012. The Minister of the Environment may also designate a project not identified in the <em><a href="http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2012/2012-07-18/html/sor-dors147-eng.html">Regulations Designating Physical Activities</a></em> if the project may cause adverse environmental effects or there are public concerns related to those effects.</p>
<p>When an EA is required under the CEAA  2012, the Commission must render an EA decision in accordance with section 52 of the CEAA 2012 before a regulatory licensing decision can be made under the NSCA to allow a project to proceed. Should the Commission determine that a designated project is not likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects in accordance with subsection 52(1) of the CEAA 2012, the Commission, in accordance with section 53, must establish through the licensing process, the mitigation measures and follow-up activities the applicant of the proposed project must take. In cases when the Commission  concludes that a project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects, the Commission, in accordance with section 52(2) of the CEAA 2012, must refer  the matter of whether those effects are justified in the circumstances to the Governor in Council.</p>

<div id="5.1"></div>
<h4 id="sec5-1" className="mrgn-tp-0">5.1 Projects on federal lands and projects outside Canada</h4>
<p>Under section 67 and 68 of the CEAA 2012, when an EA is not required, an authority (e.g., CNSC, Atomic Energy of Canada Limited or the Department of National Defence) is still required to determine the likelihood of significant adverse environmental effects that might result from a project being carried out on federal lands or outside Canada. A finding that such environmental effects are not likely or that they are likely but justified in the circumstances, in accordance with a Governor in Council decision, allows the authority to carry out the project or exercise any power or perform any duty or function under an Act of Parliament other than CEAA 2012, such as the NSCA, that could permit the project to be carried out, in whole or in part.</p>
<p>For further information on how to meet the requirements of section 67 and 68, applicants should contact the CNSC at the earliest possible stage of project planning. The Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency&#39;s <em>Operation Policy Statement - Projects on Federal Lands and Outside Canada under the CEAA, 2012</em>, published in June 2013, may also provide useful guidance.</p>
<p>This policy statement can be found at <a href="http://www.ceaa-acee.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=22CA364E-1">ceaa-acee.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=22CA364E-1</a></p>

<p>The CEAA 2012 may not apply in certain parts of Canada (e.g., Nunavut, Northwest Territories, Yukon), where there are settled land claim agreements with associated EA processes. In such cases, CNSC staff may, if requested by another jurisdiction, act as technical advisors during the EA process and be active participants at all stages. The Commission does not have a decision-making role in the EA; however, it retains decision making on all licensing matters under the NSCA.</p>

<h4 id="sec5-3" className="mrgn-tp-0">5.3	Environmental assessment and licensing</h4>
<p>The EA process under the CEAA 2012 and the CNSC licensing process may be completed via either an integrated or sequential approach, as shown in Appendix C. Early involvement of the CNSC (i.e., the planning stages) is essential to determine the appropriateness of integrating the EA and licensing processes. Since EAs can be used as planning tools by applicants, a sequential EA and licensing process may be preferred for some projects.</p>
<h5 id="sec5-3-1">5.3.1 Integrated environmental assessment and licensing process</h5>
<p>Integration of the EA and licensing  processes requires the EA to be conducted at the same time as the review of the  applicant&#39;s licensing information. This enables the CNSC to present its  recommendations regarding the EA and the licensing application to the  Commission at the same hearing. Successful integration of the licensing process  with the EA depends on the applicant&#39;s ability to submit all licensing  information to the CNSC&#39;s satisfaction within the EA timelines.</p>
<h5 id="sec5-3-2">5.3.2 Sequential environmental assessment and licensing process</h5>
<p>A sequential process is an option that  may be followed, for example, when an applicant uses the EA to determine the  feasibility of a project. Upon completion of an EA, the onus is on the  applicant to submit all necessary licensing documentation in order to fulfill  the CNSC&#39;s licensing requirements to undertake project activities. The  licensing process ensures that proposed project activities are within the  bounds of the completed EA prior to the consideration of a regulatory decision.  Should significant time lapse between the EA decision and the submission of the  corresponding licence application, CNSC staff may require the applicant to  update the EA to take into consideration new science, changes in the  environment and any new technology.</p>

<div id="5.4"></div>
<h4 id="sec5-4" className="mrgn-tp-0">5.4	Aboriginal consultation</h4>
<p>Aboriginal groups whose potential or established Aboriginal or treaty rights may potentially be adversely affected by the proposed project will be consulted throughout the EA process as per CNSC&#39;s<em> Codification of  Current Practice: Commitment to Aboriginal Consultation</em>.</p>
<p>The CNSC establishes project-specific Aboriginal consultation processes, based on guiding principles of Canada&#39;s case law and best consultation practices as outlined in <em>Aboriginal Consultation and Accommodation - Updated Guidelines for Federal Officials to Fulfill the Legal Duty to Consult</em>. These processes offer opportunities for CNSC staff and Aboriginal peoples to meet and discuss issues, and are meant to  be as accessible as reasonably possible to Aboriginal peoples.</p>
<p>The consultation activities for a given project may vary with the circumstances such that, for example, CNSC staff may work more closely  with Aboriginal peoples where the potential for more serious adverse effects on Aboriginal interests arising from a Commission decision appears to be a possibility.</p>
<p>The CNSC, as the Crown Consultation Coordinator, will support a whole-of-government approach to Aboriginal consultation, with the aim of coordinating consultation activity efforts and providing a one-window approach to sharing information with, and addressing concerns raised by interested Aboriginal groups. The EA process under the CEAA 2012 is flexible and intended to address concerns raised related to the project.</p>
<p>Early engagement by the applicant is an important part of good governance, sound policy development, and decision-making. The applicant therefore should demonstrate that engagement with the appropriate parties has been integrated into project planning. Early engagement by applicants helps to ensure that relevant issues are identified and addressed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Additional requirements and guidance are found in the CNSC regulatory document RG/GD-99.3, <em>Public Information and Disclosure</em>.</p>

<p>The CNSC&#39;s Participant Funding Program gives members of the public, Aboriginal groups and  other stakeholders the opportunity to request funding in support of their  participation in the CNSC&#39;s regulatory decision-making process.</p>
<p>Participant funding for a given EA under the CEAA 2012 is decided on a case-by-case basis. Should participant funding be made available, a notice regarding the funding opportunity will be posted on the CNSC&#39;s Web site, and the CNSC subscription list will be notified when the notice is posted there. Aboriginal groups may be  notified directly by the CNSC.</p>

<ul>
<li>identify projects that must undergo an EA in accordance with the CEAA 2012 </li>
<li>develop an understanding of the CNSC&#39;s regulatory requirements </li>
<li>understand the CNSC&#39;s EA and licensing processes (i.e., integrated EA and licensing vs. sequential EA and licensing) and associated timelines </li>
<li>discuss whether EA guidelines are required for a proposed project</li>

<p>The CNSC, as the sole federal RA for nuclear projects, will contact other provincial and territorial jurisdictions, as appropriate, to determine whether there are other jurisdictional EA requirements. Where applicable, the CNSC will work with other jurisdictions to determine if the EA requirements of all jurisdictions can be addressed through a single EA process to reduce duplication and provide regulatory efficiency. Relevant federal and provincial EA agreements provide direction regarding jurisdictional roles and responsibilities in the assessment of such projects.</p>
<p>In accordance with section 26 of the CEAA 2012, the CNSC may also delegate to another jurisdiction the conduct of an EA or any part thereof. In such cases, the responsibility for making a decision under subsection 27(1) of CEAA 2012 remains with the Commission. Delegation of EA-related matters for a given project will be determined on a case-by-case basis in accordance with section 26 of the CEAA 2012.</p>
<p>The CNSC will also contact other federal authorities (FAs), to determine if additional FA regulatory decisions are required to allow the project to proceed. Should additional FA regulatory decisions be required, the CNSC will engage the FA appropriately throughout the  EA process. In accordance with section 20 of the CEAA 2012, the CNSC may also request an FA to provide specialist or expert information or knowledge to support the conduct of the EA.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Early discussions with other federal, provincial or territorial authorities often occur as soon as an applicant&#39;s intent to seek regulatory approval for a proposed project is known.</p>

<h4 id="sec6-6" className="mrgn-tp-0">Step 6: Determination of participation opportunities</h4>
<p>In accordance with section 24 of the CEAA 2012, the CNSC must ensure that the public is provided with an opportunity to participate in the EA. The breadth and timing of public participation is at the discretion of the CNSC.</p>
<p>To determine the specific breadth and timing of public participation opportunities during the EA process, the CNSC completes a public participation determination. This determination is completed in accordance with appendix B. The criteria have been divided into the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>public and Aboriginal interest criteria</li>
<li>environmental characterization and potential impact criteria</li>
<li>additional factors (e.g., other jurisdictions, participant funding)</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the assessment of the criteria, as outlined in appendix B, the CNSC determines the level of public participation to be very low, low, moderate, or high. Each level corresponds to public participation opportunities outlined in table 3. Additional participation opportunities may also be provided, as appropriate.</p>
<p>Aboriginal consultation activities are integrated to the extent possible in the EA process, which includes the involvement of Aboriginal groups in the participation opportunities outlined in table 3. For further information on Aboriginal consultation for EAs, please refer to section 5.4 above.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> During the conduct of the EA, if the CNSC becomes aware of new information, additional public participation activities may be considered for addressing any issues or concerns.</p>

<h4 id="sec6-8" className="mrgn-tp-0">Step 8: EA guidelines</h4>
<p>The CNSC&#39;s EA process may include project-specific guidance for the conduct of technical studies to meet the requirements of the CEAA 2012. This guidance is known as &quot;EA guidelines&quot;. The CNSC will prepare EA guidelines on a project-specific basis, with the level of detail required being commensurate with the nature and scope of the project and environment.</p>
<p>The EA guidelines also contain CNSC staff recommendations to the Commission on level of public participation in the EA (step 6), and CEAA-related decisions, such as additional factors to be considered, and the scope of all factors (outlined in step 9).</p>
<p>If the environmental impact statement (EIS) and supporting technical studies have already been completed and the CNSC deems that project-specific EA guidelines are not required, the process may advance to step 11, initiating the technical review of the applicant submissions. In this case, the CEAA 2012-related decisions outlined in step 9, will be made in an abridged hearing following the technical review (step 11), or will be confirmed by the Commission during the hearing on the EA Report (step 13).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The need for EA guidelines is determined by the CNSC during step 1. Should EA guidelines not be required, interested parties shall be provided an opportunity to review the EIS and supporting technical studies.</p>
<h5 id="sec6-8-1">Step 8.1: External review period</h5>
<p>In accordance with section 20 of the CEAA 2012, the CNSC may request other FAs to review the EA guidelines. Comments received will be considered in the development of the  EA guidelines.</p>
<p>Depending on the outcome of the public participation determination (see step 6), a public review period may be conducted in order to solicit the views of the public, Aboriginal groups and other stakeholders on the EA guidelines. Identified  Aboriginal groups will be notified of the external review period, and provided with information on the timelines and process to submit comments. Comments received will be dispositioned and included in the CMD prepared in the next step.</p>
<h5 id="sec6-8-2">Step 8.2: Drafting and submission of a CMD on EA guidelines</h5>
<p>The CNSC prepares a CMD outlining the necessary EA-related decisions included in the EA guidelines for the project. The CMD is submitted to the Commission, along with the EA guidelines, and any public comments and associated dispositions as applicable, to inform the Commission&#39;s decisions.</p>

<h4 id="sec6-9" className="mrgn-tp-0">Step 9: Commission hearing on the EA guidelines</h4>
<p>The Commission will consider the EA guidelines in the context of an abridged hearing and make a decision on the following items related to the CEAA 2012:</p>
<ul>
<li>additional factors to be considered in the conduct of the EA (subsection 19(1)(j))</li>
<li>the scope of the factors (subsection 19(2))</li>
<li>whether community knowledge and Aboriginal traditional knowledge should be considered (subsection 19(3))</li>
<li>whether the CNSC requires the applicant to collect any information or undertake any study for the purpose of conducting the EA or preparing the EA report with respect to the EA of the designated project (subsection 23(2)) (e.g., EIS)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Commission also makes a decision in relation to the CNSC staff&#39;s recommended level of public participation based on the completed public participation determination.</p>
<p>For an abridged hearing, a &quot;notice of hearing&quot; is posted on the CNSC Web site prior to the scheduled hearing. This type of Commission hearing is generally held in a closed session and has limited or no public involvement. Should there be public involvement (i.e.,  written interventions) it will be indicated in the &quot;notice of hearing&quot;, and identified Aboriginal groups will be formally notified.</p>
<p>Once the Commission has rendered its decision, the <em>Record of Proceedings, Including Reasons for Decision</em> is published on the CNSC Web site and the CEAR. Aboriginal groups and members of the public who have expressed an interest in a particular project may be directly notified of the decision. This notification will also be circulated to the CNSC subscription list.</p>
<h5 id="sec6-9-1">Step 9.1: Finalizing and issuing of the EA guidelines</h5>
<p>Should the Commission approve the EA guidelines, CNSC staff will ensure that any additional requirements identified by the Commission in the <em>Record of Proceedings, Including Reasons for Decision</em> are included.</p>
<p>The CNSC will then formally issue the final EA guidelines to the applicant.</p>

<p>Once the CNSC is satisfied that applicants have adequately addressed all information gaps, the technical review is completed.</p>
<h5 id="sec6-11-1">Step 11.1: External review period</h5>
<p>The CNSC is also responsible for determining if FAs should be involved in the technical review to contribute any specialist or expert information or knowledge.</p>
<p>Based on the results of the public participation determination (see step 6), a public review of the applicant&#39;s EIS and supporting technical studies may be conducted. This public review and the CNSC&#39;s technical review may be conducted concurrently, and comments received within the scope of the EA may be submitted to the applicant for clarification.</p>
<p>The applicant shall address concerns raised during the external review period, if needed and as determined by the CNSC.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> During this time, the CNSC may undertake outreach activities, such as open houses, information sessions, or consultation activities with interested Aboriginal groups, to ensure that all interested parties have the opportunity to ask questions and share their comments with the CNSC.</p>

The EA report includes CNSC staff&#39;s conclusions regarding the potential environmental effects, the proposed mitigation measures and the significance of adverse environmental effects, as  well as follow-up program requirements.</p>
<p>The CNSC will draft the EA report, synthesizing the applicant&#39;s technical information and taking into consideration the results of the technical review, including any comments received from other parties.</p>
<h5 id="sec6-12-1">Step 12.1: External review period</h5>
<p>In accordance with section 20 of the CEAA 2012, the CNSC may request other FAs to review the EA report. Comments received will be considered in the development of the EA report.</p>
<p>Depending on the outcome of the public participation determination, a public review period may be conducted to solicit the views of the public and Aboriginal groups on the EA report. Identified Aboriginal groups will be sent a notification, which outlines the timelines and process by which to submit comments.

<p>The Commission considers information during a hearing and then renders an EA decision.</p>
<p>For public  hearings, a &quot;notice of public Commission hearing&quot; is posted on the CNSC Web site at least 60 days before the scheduled hearing. Identified Aboriginal groups will be sent the notice of public Commission hearing, and will be provided information on the process by which to intervene. This is to enable interested parties to request intervenor status from the Commission for the public hearing and to send their comments on the EA.</p>
<p>Public hearings are usually held at the CNSC headquarters in Ottawa, but the Commission may decide to hold such a hearing in a community in the vicinity of the proposed project.</p>
<p>The exact nature of the public hearing will depend on whether the project is following an integrated or sequential EA and licensing process. This will be detailed in the notice of public Commission hearing.</p>
<p>An EA decision will be taken only when the Commission is satisfied that it has sufficient information to do so.</p>

<p>Following the public hearing, the Commission must render a decision on  the EA whether the project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects, taking into account mitigation measures that were identified during the EA, before a licensing decision can be made to allow the project to proceed.</p>
<p>When the Commission concludes that a project is not likely to cause  significant adverse environmental effects in accordance with subsection&nbsp;52(1) of the CEAA 2012, the Commission, in accordance with section 53, must establish through the licensing process, the mitigation measures and follow-up activities that the applicant of the proposed project must take.</p>
<p>When the Commission concludes that a project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effect in accordance with subsection 52(2) of the CEAA 2012, the Commission must refer to the Governor in Council the matter of whether those effects are justified in the circumstances.</p>
<p>After the Commission has rendered its EA decision, the <em>Record of Proceedings, Including Reasons for Decision</em> is issued through  the Commission&#39;s Secretariat and posted on the CNSC Web site and the CEAR. Identified Aboriginal groups and the CNSC subscription list will be notified when an EA decision is published.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Should the conduct of the EA, or any part thereof, be delegated to another jurisdiction, as described in step 4, the Commission must render an EA decision before a regulatory decision can be made.</p>

<p>This appendix outlines the criteria-based approach used to support making the following determinations:</p>
<ul>
<li>the participation opportunities, and the need for and scope of the EA Conclusion Report under the NSCA</li>
<li>the level of public participation for an EA under the CEAA2012</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of this appendix is to provide guidance to CNSC staff in making the appropriate EA determination and to ensure participation opportunities are identified early in the regulatory process. This information is also intended for all stakeholders, including the public and Aboriginal groups, to gain a better understanding of the process and criteria used by the CNSC in making the appropriate determination.</p>
<p>This criteria-based approach ensures that the CNSC implements a consistent, impartial, effective and transparent process that ensures Aboriginal groups and public participation in CNSC regulatory activities.</p>
<h4 id="appB1-2">B.1.2 Scope</h4>
<p>This appendix should be used by CNSC staff upon receipt of a licence application for a proposed project.</p>
<p>For EAs under the NSCA, this appendix may be used to support the determination of participation opportunities (section 3, step 3), and the need for and scope of the EA Conclusion Report (section 3, step 8) for EAs conducted under the NSCA.</p>
<p>For EAs under the CEAA 2012, this appendix should be used to complete the public participation determination (section 6, step 6), once it has been determined that an EA under the CEAA 2012 is required. The public participation determination will identify the participation opportunities to be provided during the conduct of the EA.</p>

<p>The EA process under the CEAA 2012 and the CNSC licensing process may be completed in an integrated or sequential approach. If an EA is completed in an integrated approach, the technical reviews are conducted concurrently to facilitate a single EA and licensing CMD, hearing/meeting and decision. If an EA is completed in a sequential approach, the EA decision must be rendered before the Commission considers a licensing decision.</p>

This mode of failure is also described as failure due to elastic instability.</p>  <p><strong>Burnup</strong> - The induced nuclear transformation of atoms during reactor operation.</p>  <p><strong>CFR</strong> - U.S. Code of Federal Regulations</p>  <p><strong>Ci</strong> - Curie</p>  <p><strong>CNSC</strong> - Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission</p>  <p><strong>Crud</strong> - A colloquial term for corrosion and wear products (for example, rust particles) that become radioactive (i.e. activated) when exposed to radiation. Because the activated deposits were first discovered at Chalk River, Canada, &#8220;crud&#8221; has been used as an acronym for Chalk River Unidentified Deposits.</p>  <p><strong>CSA</strong> - Canadian Standards Association</p>  <p><strong>Criticality Safety Index (CSI)</strong> - A number assigned to a package, overpack, or freight container containing fissile material that provides control over the accumulation of packages, overpacks or freight containers containing fissile material. </p>  <p><strong>DOT</strong> - U.S. Department of Transportation</p>
<p><strong>Fissile material</strong> - Uranium-233, uranium-235, plutonium-239, plutonium-241, or any combination of these radionuclides, with the exception of:</p>
<ul>  	<li>natural uranium or depleted uranium that is not irradiated, and</li>  	<li>natural uranium or depleted uranium that has been irradiated in thermal reactors only.</li>  </ul>

Attenuations are treated in an approximate manner through the use of built-in attenuation coefficients and build-up factors.</p>  <p><strong>Poisson&#8217;s ratio&nbsp; </strong> - The ratio of lateral strain to longitudinal strain, within the elastic range, for axially-loaded specimens.

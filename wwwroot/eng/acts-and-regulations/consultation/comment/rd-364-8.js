<a name="8.0"></a>  	<h2><strong>8.0 ACCEPTANCE TESTS AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM</strong></h2>  <p>This section of the application should describe the acceptance tests and maintenance program, as required by Paragraph&nbsp;807(d) of TS-R-1 as referenced in Paragraph&nbsp;7(1)(<em>a</em>) of the PTNS Regulations, to be used for the packaging in compliance with Subpart G of 10 CFR Part 71 and Paragraph&nbsp;501 of TS-R-1 as referenced in Subsection 16(4) of the PTNS Regulations. The acceptance tests and maintenance program will be included in the certificate by reference as a condition of approval.</p>
<a name="8.1"></a>  	<h3><strong>8.1 Acceptance Tests</strong></h3>  <p>This section should describe the tests, as required in 10 CFR 71.85 and Paragraph&nbsp;501 of TS-R-1 as referenced in Subsection 16(4) of the PTNS Regulations, to be performed before the first use of each packaging. Each test and its acceptance criteria should be described. The acceptance tests should confirm that each packaging is fabricated in accordance with the drawings referenced in the package approval. The specificity of the information provided on the acceptance tests should be sufficient to verify the adequacy of the packaging. </p>  <div style="padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px;background-color:#efefef;border:1px solid black;">  <p>Paragraph&nbsp;501 of TS-R-1 and 10 CFR 71.85 contain slightly different requirements for acceptance testing. 10 CFR 71.85 requires that it be determined that there are no cracks, pinholes, uncontrolled voids, or other defects that could significantly reduce the effectiveness of the packaging; Paragraph&nbsp;501 of TS-R-1 requires that the effectiveness of its shielding and containment and, where necessary, the heat transfer characteristics and the effectiveness of the confinement system, are within the limits for the approved design. If the design pressure of the containment system exceeds 35 kPa (gauge), Paragraph&nbsp;501 requires it be ensured that the containment system of each package conforms to the approved design requirements relating to the capability of that system to maintain its integrity under that pressure. 10&nbsp;CFR&nbsp;71.85 more specifically requires a test of the containment system at an internal pressure at least 50 percent higher than the maximum normal operating pressure. </p>  </div>  <p>Additional regulatory requirements of 10 CFR Part 71 applicable to the acceptance tests include the following:</p>  <ol>
<li> The application must identify codes, standards, and the specific provisions of the quality assurance program used for the acceptance testing of the packaging (10&nbsp;CFR&nbsp;71.31(c) and 10 CFR 71.37(b));</li>

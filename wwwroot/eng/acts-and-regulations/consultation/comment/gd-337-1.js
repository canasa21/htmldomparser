<h2><a name="P258_12519" id="P258_12519"></a>4.0 Safety Objectives and Concepts</h2>
<h3><a name="P259_12553" id="P259_12553"></a>4.1 General nuclear safety objective</h3>  <p>The general nuclear safety objective adopted in RD-337 version 2 is compatible with the purpose of the NSCA, which &#8220;provides for the limitation, to a reasonable level and in a manner that is consistent with Canada&#8217;s international obligations, of the risks to national security, the health and safety of persons and the environment that are associated with the development, production and use of nuclear energy and the production, possession and use of nuclear substances, prescribed equipment and prescribed information&#8221;.</p>  <p>The general nuclear safety objective&nbsp;of RD-337&nbsp;version 2&nbsp;is derived from the&nbsp;IAEA Safety Series No. 110, <em>The Safety of Nuclear Installations,</em> which states that the general nuclear safety objective&nbsp;is&nbsp;&#8220;to protect individuals, society and the environment from harm by establishing and maintaining in nuclear installations effective defences against radiological hazards&#8221;.</p>  <h4><a name="P263_13496" id="P263_13496"></a>4.1.1 Radiation protection objective</h4>  <p>The radiation protection objective of RD-337 version 2 is also derived from the IAEA document <em>The Safety</em> <em>of Nuclear Installations</em>, which states that the radiation protection objective is &#8220;to ensure that in all operational states radiation exposure within the installation or due to any planned release of radioactive material from the installation is kept below prescribed limits and as low as reasonable achievable, and to ensure mitigation of the radiological consequences of any accidents&#8221;.</p>  <p>As stated in <em>The Safety</em> <em>of Nuclear Installations</em>, the radiation protection objective &#8220;does not preclude limited exposure of people or the release of legally authorized quantities of radioactive materials to the environment from installations in operational states.&nbsp;Such exposures and releases must be strictly controlled and must be in compliance with operational limits and radiation protection standards&#8221;.</p>  <h4><a name="P267_14443" id="P267_14443"></a>4.1.2 Technical safety objectives</h4>  <p>The technical safety objectives of RD-337 version&nbsp;2 are also derived from <em>The Safety of</em> <em>Nuclear Installations,</em> which&nbsp;states that the technical safety objectives are &#8220;to take all reasonably practicable measures to&nbsp;prevent accidents in nuclear installations and to mitigate their consequences should they occur; to ensure with a high level of confidence that, for all possible accidents taken into account in the design of the installation, including those of very low probability, any radiological consequences would be minor and below prescribed limits; and to ensure that the likelihood of accidents with serious radiological consequences is extremely low&#8221;.</p>  <h4><a name="P269_15141" id="P269_15141"></a>4.1.3 Environmental protection objective</h4>  <p>The environmental protection objective provides completeness in the Canadian&nbsp;context, to ensure the design includes adequate environmental protection provisions. </p>  <a name="4.2"></a>
<h3><a name="P271_15344" id="P271_15344"></a>4.2 Application of the technical safety objectives</h3>  <p>The&nbsp;technical safety objectives&nbsp;defined&nbsp;above establish general objectives to be met&nbsp;to ensure a high level of safety; however, they&nbsp;do not state how the achievement of such objectives should be quantitatively measured.&nbsp;To this end,&nbsp;RD-337 version 2&nbsp;provides&nbsp;quantitative criteria and goals for nuclear power plant designs, in the form of dose acceptance criteria and safety goals.</p>  <h4><a name="P273_15818" id="P273_15818"></a>4.2.1 Dose acceptance criteria </h4>  <p>Deterministic safety analysis is performed to demonstrate that the dose acceptance criteria for accidents within the design basis are met with a high degree of confidence.&nbsp;The analysis demonstrates that the fundamental safety functions are fulfilled by the safety systems using conservative assumptions. The fundamental safety functions are described in section 6.2 of RD-337 version 2.</p>  <p>The values adopted in RD-337 version 2 for the dose acceptance criteria for anticipated operational occurrences (AOOs) and design basis accidents (DBAs) are&nbsp;consistent with accepted international practices, and take into&nbsp;account&nbsp;the recommendations&nbsp;of the IAEA and the International Commission on Radiological Protection. </p>  <h4><a name="P276_16562" id="P276_16562"></a>4.2.2 Safety goals</h4>  <p>Safety goals have been&nbsp;established to assist in judging the acceptability of a nuclear power plant design, using a&nbsp;risk-informed approach.&nbsp;The IAEA publication <em>Basic Safety Principles for Nuclear Power Plants</em> (75-INSAG-3 Rev. 1, INSAG-12) notes that: &#8220;The comparison of risks due to nuclear plants with other industrial risks to which people and the environment are exposed makes it necessary to use calculational models in risk analysis.&nbsp;To make full use of these techniques and to support implementation of the general nuclear safety objective, it is important that quantitative targets, &#8216;safety goals&#8217;, be formulated&#8221;.</p>  <h5>Qualitative safety goals</h5>  <p>The qualitative safety goals have been established in RD-337 version 2, to ensure that members of the public are not exposed to any significant risk from the operation of a nuclear power plant, in addition to the other risks to which they are normally exposed. The achievement of&nbsp;these goals is met through the application of the quantitative safety goals.<a name="P280_17706" id="P280_17706"><br />  </a></p>  <h5>Quantitative application of the safety goals</h5>  <p>The demonstration that the design meets the quantitative safety goals of RD-337 version 2 for core damage frequency, small release frequency, and large release frequency, is performed using probabilistic techniques.&nbsp;</p>  <p>As stated in RD-337 version 2, &#8220;<em>core damage frequency is a measure of the plant&#8217;s accident preventative capabilities</em>.&nbsp;<em>Small release frequency and large release frequency are measures of the plant&#8217;s accident mitigative capabilities. They also represent measures of risk to society and to the environment due to the operation of a nuclear power plant</em>&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The values adopted in RD-337 version 2 for the quantitative safety goals are consistent with accepted international practice for new nuclear power plants. </p>  <p>A comprehensive probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) considers the probability, progression and consequences of equipment failures or transient conditions, to derive numerical estimates for the safety of the plant.&nbsp;Core damage frequency is determined by a Level 1 PSA, which identifies and quantifies the sequence of events that may lead to significant core degradation.&nbsp;The small release frequency and large release frequency are determined by a Level 2 PSA, which starts from the results of a Level 1 PSA, analyses the containment behaviour, evaluates the radionuclides released from the failed fuel, and quantifies the releases to the environment. </p>  <p>Further details on PSAs are contained in section 9.5 of this document and CNSC S-294, <em>Probabilistic Safety Assessment (PSA) for Nuclear Power Plants</em>.</p>  <h4><a name="P292_19338" id="P292_19338"></a>4.2.3 Safety analyses</h4>  <p>Guidance on safety analysis is contained in section 9.0 and further information is provided in CNSC RD-310, <em>Safety Analysis for Nuclear Power Plants </em>and GD-310,<em> Guidance on Safety Analysis for Nuclear Power Plants</em>.</p>  <h4><a name="P294_19573" id="P294_19573"></a>4.2.4 Accident mitigation and management</h4>  <p>Sufficient information for this section is found in RD-337 version 2, <em>Design of New Nuclear Power Plants</em>.

Regardless of the approaches and terminologies used, the design authority should provide clear definitions of the OLC terminologies used. The design should also include clear objectives and goals for the OLCs.</p>  <p>The information related to OLCs should list the relevant standards (national or international) used, and document how the requirements from these standards have been met.</p>  <p>OLCs may vary depending on nuclear reactor design, general safety philosophy, and the plant&#8217;s operating configuration.</p>  <p>OLCs should be defined for a suitable set of bounding plant operating configurations, and be based on the approved design of the plant.</p>  <h5>Additional information</h5>  <p>Further information is available in:</p>  <ul>

<h2><a name="P386_27840" id="P386_27840"></a>6.0 Guidance on Safety Requirements</h2>  <h3><a name="P387_27875" id="P387_27875"></a>6.1 Application of defence in depth</h3>  <p>RD-337 version 2 requires that &#8220;<em>defence in depth shall be achieved at the design phase through the application of design provisions specific to the five levels of defence</em>&#8221;. </p>  <p>IAEA<em> </em>INSAG-10, <em>Defence in Depth in Nuclear Safety</em>, a report by the International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group, provides information leading to the concept and application of defence in depth.</p>  <p>Guidance on performing a systematic assessment of the defence in depth can be obtained from the IAEA safety reports series No. 46, <em>Assessment of Defence in Depth for Nuclear Power Plants</em>. </p>  <p>The application of defence in depth in the design should ensure the following: </p>  <ul>
<li>The approach to defence in depth used in the design should ensure that all aspects of design at the SSCs level have been covered, with emphasis on SSCs that are important to safety.</li>
<li> The defence in depth should not be significantly degraded if the SSC has multiple functions (e.g., for CANDU reactors, the moderator and end-shield cooling systems may serve the functions of a process system and include the functions of mitigating design extension conditions (DECs)).</li>
<li> The principle of multiple physical barriers to the release of radioactive material should be incorporated in the design; there should be a limited number of cases where there is a reduction in the number of physical barriers (as may be the case where some components carrying radioactive material serve the function of primary coolant barrier and containment), and adequate justification should exist for such design choices.</li>
<li> The design (e.g., in safety design guides, management system programs) should provide:</li>
<ul>
<li> levels of defence in depth that are addressed by individual SSCs</li>
<li> supporting analysis and calculation</li>
<li> evaluation of operating procedures</li>
</ul>
<li> The safety analysis should demonstrate that the challenges to the physical barriers do not exceed their physical capacity.</li>
<li> The structure for defence in depth provisions at each level of defence should be established for a given plant design, and the evaluation of the design from the point of view of maintaining each safety function should be carried out. This evaluation should consider each and every one of the provisions for mitigation of a given challenge mechanism, and confirm that it is well founded, sufficient, feasible, and correctly engineered within the design.</li>
<li>Special attention should be given to the feasibility of a given provision and the existence of supporting safety analyses. Deficiencies in the completeness of the supporting safety analyses should be documented and flagged as issues to be queried.</li>  </ul>  <h4><a name="P406_30516" id="P406_30516"></a>6.1.1 Physical barriers</h4>  <p>The independence between all levels of defence should be achieved, in particular, through diverse provisions. The strengthening of each of these levels separately would provide, as far as reasonably achievable, an overall reinforcement of defence in depth. For example, the use of dedicated systems to deal with DECs ensures the independence of the 4th defence level.</p>  <p>For independent effectiveness of the different levels of defence, any design features that aim at preventing an accident should not belong to the same level of defence as the design features that aim at mitigating the consequences of the accident.</p>  <a name="6.2"></a>

This is done to ensure that doses to site personnel and members of the public are ALARA and will not exceed the applicable dose limits of the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations </em>and relevant dose acceptance criteria and safety goals in RD-337 version 2. Radiation doses resulting from the operation of the NPP should be reduced by means of engineered controls and radiation protection measures to levels such that any further expenditure on design, construction and operational measures would not be warranted by the expected reduction in radiation doses.</p>  <p>The radiation dose assessment process should include the expected occupancy of the NPP&#8217;s radiation areas, along with estimated annual person-Sv doses associated with major functions, including radioactive waste handling, normal maintenance, special maintenance, refuelling and in-service inspection. Such assessments should include information as to how ALARA and operating experience are used in the design to deal with dose-significant contributors.</p>  <h5>Additional information</h5>  <p>Further information is available in:</p>  <ul>

<h3><a name="P422_33437" id="P422_33437"></a>6.5 Exclusion zone </h3>  <p>As defined in the <em>Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations</em>, an exclusion zone is defined as &#8220;<em>a parcel of land within or surrounding a nuclear facility on which there is no permanent dwelling and over which a licensee has the legal authority to exercise control</em>&#8221;.</p>  <p>Historically, the exclusion zone for nuclear power plants in Canada has been defined as 914 metres from the reactor building.&nbsp;Rather than prescribe a particular size for the exclusion zone, RD-337 version 2 defines the factors that must be considered in establishing an appropriate size including&nbsp;evacuation needs, land usage needs, security requirements and environmental factors.</p>  <h5>Evacuation needs</h5>  <p>The design should take into account emergency response requirements based on the size of the exclusion zone and the facilities and infrastructures that are within the zone. Generally, a larger exclusion zone would require more emergency response time and capability. </p>  <p>The exclusion zone boundary should be defined with consideration for the capabilities of onsite and offsite emergency response. The design also considers projected changes over time in land use and population density, which could adversely affect response times, or the ability to shelter or evacuate persons from both the site itself and associated emergency planning regions.</p>  <p>Evacuation needs are generally based on existing provincial nuclear emergency response plans.</p>  <h5>Land usage needs</h5>  <p>The design should ensure that the exclusion zone is large enough to accommodate the site for the nuclear plant (accounting for the full number of units postulated to be built at the site, whether or not they would be built immediately). </p>  <p>The design activities should seek to optimize land usage by the plant as part of determining the exclusion zone.</p>  <h5>Security requirements</h5>  <p>The design should provide security requirements based on the size of the exclusion zone, the facilities and infrastructures that are within the zone, and the design of the facility. Generally, a larger exclusion zone would require more security capabilities, in order to avoid a longer response time. Physical characteristics of the site itself (which include geographical characteristics, such as proximity to elevated land) also play a role in determining these requirements.</p>  <p>The design authority may decide to mitigate these risks while maintaining a smaller exclusion zone, by choosing highly robust facility designs, applying engineered security measures to the site, and having a well-designed security program. These engineered measures should be described.</p>  <p>In establishing the radius of the exclusion zone boundary, the design should take into account:</p>  <ul>
<li>the site selection and threat assessment report </li>
<li> facility robustness against natural and human induced external events (including malevolent acts)</li>
<li> the capability of the onsite security program, along with any offsite security resources that will supplement the onsite security program</li>  </ul>  <p>In each of the above parameters, the design should take into account projected changes over time in land use and population density, which could adversely affect that parameter. The design should be such that the exclusion zone, as established at the design stage, will be sustainable for the full lifecycle of the facility.</p>  <p>The acceptability of the information to be provided in support of the above is discussed in section 7.22 of this document.</p>  <h5>Environmental factors</h5>  <p>Environmental factors which may have an&nbsp;impact on the size of the exclusion zone include local meteorological conditions which could affect the radiological dose received from members of the public.&nbsp;The design authority may use generic site data using conservative assumptions regarding meteorological conditions in the absence of a specific site.</p>  <p>The <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em> establish an effective&nbsp;dose limit of 1 mSv per year&nbsp;for members of the public.&nbsp;This limit implies that a hypothetical member of the public who lives at the exclusion zone boundary for 1 year&nbsp;(since no permanent&nbsp;dwelling is permitted within the exclusion zone) would not accumulate a dose of more than 1 mSv from the operation of&nbsp;the nuclear power plant.&nbsp; </p>  <p>The dose acceptance criteria in section 4.2.1 of RD-337 version 2&nbsp;must be met at the site boundary.</p>  <h5>Additional information</h5>  <p>Further information is available in:</p>  <ul>

<h2><a name="P456_38616" id="P456_38616"></a>7.0 Guidance on General Design Requirements</h2>  <h3><a name="P457_38659" id="P457_38659"></a>7.1 Classification of SSCs</h3>  <p>The method for classifying the safety significance of SSCs important to safety should be based primarily on deterministic methodologies, complemented (where appropriate) by probabilistic methods. The safety classification of SSCs should be an iterative process that continues throughout the design process.</p>  <p>The SSC classification process should include the following activities:</p>  <ul>
<li> review and definition of postulated initiating events (PIEs)</li>
<li> identification of plant-specific preventive safety features and mitigatory safety functions, based on the associated system or subsystem</li>
<li> safety categorization of the preventive safety features and mitigatory safety functions, in accordance with their safety significance and role in achieving fundamental safety functions</li>
<li> identification of SSCs that provide the preventive safety features and mitigatory safety functions</li>
<li> assignment of SSCs to a safety class corresponding to the safety category</li>
<li> SSC classification verification</li>
<li> identification of engineering design rules for classified SSCs</li>  </ul>  <p>This approach should be used for all SSCs including pressure retaining components, electrical, instrumentation and control (I&amp;C) and civil structures.</p>  <p>The identified PIEs should be grouped into limiting cases, which are referred to as bounding or enveloping PIEs. Once these bounding PIEs are known and understood, the required safety functions can be identified. Each safety function can be assigned to either a preventive safety feature, or mitigatory safety function. The number of category and class may be chosen to allow for graded design rules. </p>  <p>As stated in RD-337 version 2, &#8220;<em>all SSCs shall be identified as either important or not important to safety. The criteria for determining safety importance are based on</em>:</p>  <ol>
<li><em> safety function(s) to be performed</em></li>
<li><em>consequence(s) of failure</em></li>
<li><em> probability that the SSC will be called upon to perform the safety function</em></li>
<li><em>the time following a PIE at which the SSC will be called upon to operate, and the expected duration of that operation&#8221;</em></li>  </ol>  <p>Redundancy and diversity could be considered to apply to factors 3 and 4 above. </p>  <p>The time following the PIE, as identified in factor 4, captures the need for automatic action for short timescales, or manual actions being acceptable for longer-term actions. The expected duration of the operation is also important since some systems may need to operate for months. Others (such as shutdown means) can complete their mission within seconds.</p>  <p>The potential severity of the consequences of a function failure should be evaluated. During the evaluation, it may be assumed that the feature or safety function to be categorized fails, and that other safety features and safety functions remain functional. </p>  <p>Some specific SSCs classification guidelines are given below:</p>  <ul>
<li> if there are SSCs whose failure cannot be accepted because the failure will result in unacceptable consequences with certainty, then these SSCs should be allocated to the highest safety class</li>
<li> as a general rule, supporting SSCs should be assigned to the same class as that of the frontline SSCs to be supported</li>
<li> if a particular SSC contributes to the performance of several safety functions of different categories, it should be assigned to the class corresponding to the highest safety category, requiring the most conservative design rules</li>
<li> the classification of SSCs should remain the same, regardless of the operation of the SSC (whether it is active or passive, or a combination of the two)</li>
<li> any SSC that is not part of a safety function group, but whose failure could adversely affect this safety function group in accomplishing its safety function (if this cannot be precluded by design) should be classified in accordance with the safety category of that safety function group</li>
<li> where the safety class of connecting or interacting SSCs is not the same (including cases where one SSC belonging to a safety class is connected to another SSC not important to safety), the interference between the SSCs should be separated by a device (e.g., a physical or optical isolator) classified in the higher safety class, to ensure that the failure of a lower safety class SSC will not propagate to a higher safety class SSC</li>  </ul>  <p>Although the probability of SSCs being called upon during DECs is very low, the failure of safety functions for the mitigation of DECs may lead to high severity consequences. Therefore, these safety functions should be considered a high safety category. </p>  <p>The adequacy of the safety classification should be verified using deterministic safety analysis, which should cover all PIEs and all the credited safety functions. This verification should be complemented, as appropriate, by insight from probabilistic safety assessment and by engineering judgment.</p>  <p>The appropriate design rules and limits as indicated in section 7.5 are specified in accordance with the safety class of SSCs.</p>  <a name="7.2"></a>
<h3><a name="P490_43591" id="P490_43591"></a>7.2 Plant design envelope </h3>  <p>As stated in RD-337 version 2, <em>&#8220;the design authority shall establish the plant design envelope, which comprises all plant states considered in the design: normal operation, AOOs, DBAs and DECs&#8221;</em>. </p>  <p>The design basis for each SSC important to safety should be systematically defined and justified. The design should also provide the necessary information for the operating organization to run the plant safely.</p>  <p>The conditions for deviating from conservative deterministic design principles should be clearly stated, including the basis by which such deviation would be justified on a case-by-case basis; such basis may include a more sophisticated calculation methodology, which has been well established, or a multiplicity of the ways in which a particular function can be fulfilled.</p>  <p>The design should adopt deterministic design principles of appropriate conservatism. For example, SSCs should be robust, tolerant of a large spectrum of faults with a gradual degradation in their effectiveness, and should not fail catastrophically under operational states and accident conditions.</p>  <p>A complementary design feature is a design feature added to the design as a standalone SSC, or added capability to an existing SSC to cope with DECs.</p>  <p>The design principles for complementary design features to deal with DECs do not necessarily need to incorporate the same degree of conservatism as those applied to the design up to and including DBAs. However, there should be reasonable assurance that the complementary design features will function as designed when called upon.</p>  <a name="7.3"></a>
<h3><a name="P502_45175" id="P502_45175"></a>7.3 Plant states</h3>  <p>As shown in Figure 1 of RD-337 version 2, plant states are divided into operational states and accident conditions. The design requirements of SSCs should then be developed to ensure that the plant is capable of meeting applicable deterministic and probabilistic requirements for each plant state.</p>  <p>The design should include the following: </p>  <ul>
<li>criteria for transition to normal operation following an AOO or DBA (e.g., the safety functions are provided, and the OLC limits for the operating configurations are met)</li>
<li>key parameters and characteristics for operational states, including nominal values and deviations due to uncertainties and settings of instruments, controls, trips, equipment action time, or due to process fluctuations</li>
<li> permissible conditions for different operating configurations (e.g., cold and pressurized) including transient time (e.g., power level of reactor or turbine, normal planned power transient rate, heat-up and cool-down rates) for the NPP&#8217;s operating life</li>
<li> methods of transferring the plant between different operating configurations </li>
<li> final safe configurations after AOOs, DBAs, and DECs</li>  </ul>  <h4><a name="P511_46322" id="P511_46322"></a>7.3.1 Normal operation</h4>  <p>The design ensures that normal operations are carried out safely, thereby confirming that radiation doses to workers and members of the public, as well as any planned discharges and releases of radioactive material from the plant, will be within the authorized limits specified in the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations,</em> and will meet the requirements of section 4.1.1 of RD-337 version 2.</p>  <p>Operating configurations for normal operation are addressed by the OLCs which are described in section 4.3.3. These typically include:</p>  <ul>
<li> normal reactor startup (from shutdown, through criticality, to full-power)</li>
<li>power operation, including full-power and low-power operation</li>
<li> changes in reactor power, including load-follow modes (if applicable) and return to full- power after an extended period at low-power</li>
<li> operation during transition between configurations such as reactor shutdown from power operation (hot shutdown, cool-down) </li>
<li> refuelling during normal operation, where applicable</li>
<li> shutdown in a refuelling mode or other maintenance condition that opens the reactor coolant or containment boundary</li>
<li> handling of fresh and irradiated fuel</li>  </ul>  <p>The key parameters and unique characteristics of each operational configuration, including the specific design provision for maintaining the configuration, should be identified. The permissible periods of operation at different configurations (e.g., power level) in the event of a deviation from normal operating configurations, should also be identified.</p>  <h4><a name="P524_47843" id="P524_47843"></a>7.3.2 Anticipated operational occurrences </h4>  <p>In accordance with the requirements of section 4.3.1 of RD-337 version 2 for Level 2 and Level 3 defence in depth, the design should include the results of the analyses of AOOs and DBAs in order to provide a demonstration of the robustness of the fault tolerance in the engineering design and the effectiveness of the safety systems. The analysis should cover the full range of events over the full range of reactor power. The analysis should also cover all normal operating configurations, including low-power and shutdown states.</p>  <p>For a wide range of AOOs, the design should be such that any deviations from normal operation can be detected, and that the control systems can be expected to return the plant to a safe state, normally without the activation of safety systems. For both AOOs and DBAs, there should be high confidence that qualified systems (as identified in section 5.4.4 of RD-310) can mitigate the event even when acting alone.</p>  <p>For each group of PIE it may be sufficient to analyze only a limited number of bounding initiating events, which can represent a bounding response for a group of events. The rationale for the choice of these selected bounding events should be provided. The plant parameters that are important to the outcome of the safety analysis should also be identified. These parameters would typically include:</p>  <ul>
<li> reactor power and its distribution</li>
<li> core temperature</li>
<li> fuel cladding oxidation, and deformation</li>
<li> pressures in the primary and secondary systems</li>
<li> containment parameters</li>
<li> temperatures and flows</li>
<li> reactivity coefficients</li>
<li> reactor kinetics parameters</li>
<li> reactivity worth of reactivity devices</li>  </ul>  <p>Those characteristics of the safety systems, including the operating conditions in which the systems are actuated, the time delays, and the systems&#8217; capacity after the actuation claimed in the design, should be specified and demonstrated to be consistent with the overall functional and performance requirements of the systems.</p>  <p>Refer to examples of AOOs in CNSC GD-310, <em>Guidance on Safety Analysis</em> <em>for Nuclear</em> <em>Power Plants</em>.</p>  <h4><a name="P543_49955" id="P543_49955"></a>7.3.3 Design basis accidents </h4>  <p>The design identifies the set of DBAs and associated conditions for which the NPP is designed. This includes such responses as manual initiation of systems, or other operator actions.</p>  <p>Refer to examples of DBAs in CNSC GD-310, <em>Guidance on Safety Analysis</em> <em>for Nuclear</em> <em>Power Plants</em>.</p>  <h4><a name="P547_50262" id="P547_50262"></a>7.3.4 Design extension conditions</h4>  <p>For identifying DECs, consideration should be given to:</p>  <ul>
<li> factors of the accident progression (i.e., physical conditions, processes and phenomena)</li>
<li> beyond design basis accident/severe accident scenarios resulting from initiating events, human actions, and SSC&#8217;s operability (success or failure) </li>
<li> selection of bounding events that are considered in design and determination of limiting values/ranges of the parameters of these events</li>  </ul>  <p>The design should identify the features that are designed for use in, or that are capable of preventing or mitigating events considered in DECs. These features include complementary design features and other SSCs that may be credited for DECs. These features should:</p>  <ul>
<li> be independent, to the extent practicable, of those used in more frequent accidents</li>
<li> have a reliability commensurate with the function that they are required to fulfill</li>  </ul>  <p>The choice of the DECs to be analyzed should be explained and justified, indicating whether it has been made on the basis of a PSA or other analysis that identifies potential vulnerabilities of the plant.</p>  <p>RD-337 version 2 states<em> &#8220;the design shall identify a radiological and combustible gas accident source term for use in the specification of the complementary design features for DECs&#8221;.</em> This reference source term should be calculated for a set of representative accident scenarios based on the best-estimate models. This should take into account the uncertainties of key parameters and the possible changes in governing physical processes.</p>  <p>Accidents in this category are, typically, sequences involving more than one failure (unless these are taken into account in the DBAs at the design stage). Such sequences may include DBAs with degraded performance of a safety system, and sequences that could lead to containment bypass. The analysis of those accidents may:</p>  <ul>
<li> use best estimate models and assumptions</li>
<li> take credit for realistic system action and performance beyond original intended functions, including systems not important to safety</li>
<li> take credit for realistic operator actions</li>  </ul>  <p>Where this is not possible, reasonably conservative assumptions should be made in which the uncertainties in the understanding of the physical processes being modelled are considered. The analysis should justify the approach taken.</p>  <p>Refer to examples of BDBAs in CNSC GD-310, <em>Guidance on Safety Analysis for Nuclear Power Plants</em>.</p>  <p><strong>7.3.4.1 Severe accidents</strong></p>  <p>Severe accidents represent accident conditions that involve significant fuel degradation, either in-core or in-fuel storage. </p>  <p>Detailed analysis should be performed and documented to identify and characterize accidents that can lead to significant core damage or offsite releases of radioactive material (severe accidents). In addition, evaluations should be carried out on the capability of complementary design features to cope with DECs. The challenges to the plant presented by such events, and the extent to which the design may be reasonably expected to mitigate their consequences should be considered in establishing the initial severe accident management guidelines which will facilitate meeting the expectations of CNSC G-306, <em>Severe Accident Management Programs for Nuclear Reactors</em>.</p>  <p>The design should include the analysis performed for severe accident progression and consequence evaluation including assessments on topical issues, as applicable, such as corium stratification, corium-steel-vessel thermal-chemical interaction, corium-vessel/end-shield heat transfer, hydrogen burn, steam explosion due to molten fuel-coolant interaction, and corium-concrete interaction. The results of the severe accident analysis should be taken into account when developing initial severe accident management guidelines and for emergency preparedness.</p>  <p>RD-337 version 2 states &#8220;<em>the design shall include redundant connection points (paths) to provide for</em><em> water and electrical power which may be needed to support severe accident management actions&#8221;.</em> The redundant connection points should use standard connections and be readily accessible. They should also be physically separated, to minimize risks from common-cause events. The design should facilitate the use of equipment and supplies from onsite and offsite locations, such as fuel supply, batteries, onsite and offsite temporary pumps, generators and battery chargers. </p>  <h5>Additional information</h5>  <p>Further information is available in:</p>  <ul>

In cases of SSCs for which there are no appropriate established codes or standards, an approach derived from existing codes or standards for similar SSCs may be applied; in the absence of such codes and standards, the results of experience, tests, analysis or a combination of these may be applied, and this approach should be justified.</p>  <p>A set of design limits consistent with the key physical parameters for each SSC important to safety for the nuclear power plant is specified for all operational states and for accident conditions.

<li> the plant is designed, constructed, and operated in a manner that is consistent with the assumptions and risk importance of these SSCs</li>
<li> these SSCs do not degrade to an unacceptable level during plant operations</li>
<li> the frequency of transients posing challenges to SSCs is minimized</li>
<li> these SSCs function reliably when challenged</li>  </ul>  <p>The SSC reliabilities assumed in the design stage need to be realistic and achievable.</p>  <p>Deterministic analysis or other methods may be used if the PSA lacks effective models or data.</p>  <h4><a name="P706_65996" id="P706_65996"></a>7.6.1 Common-cause failures</h4>  <p><strong>7.6.1.1 Separation</strong></p>  <p>Physical separation may be achieved by barriers, distance (both horizontal and vertical) or a combination of the two. For example, the design may provide elevation differences of redundant equipment to protect against flooding and to ensure water-tightness.</p>  <p><strong>7.6.1.2 Diversity</strong></p>  <p>The design should implement adequate diversity in safety systems, such as:</p>  <ul>
<li> design diversity</li>
<li>equipment diversity</li>
<li> functional diversity</li>
<li> human diversity</li>  </ul>  <p>The design for instrumentation and control systems (I&amp;Cs) should also consider:</p>  <ul>
<li> signal diversity</li>
<li> software diversity</li>  </ul>  <p>For I&amp;C systems important to safety, it is recommended to use an automated diverse backup system. A manual diverse backup system could be used; its justification should include a human factor engineering analysis. </p>  <p>The following diversity strategies should be considered: </p>  <ul>
<li> different technologies </li>
<li> different approaches within the same technology</li>
<li> different architectures within the same technology</li>  </ul>  <p>A diversity and defence in depth analysis should be conducted, to assess design vulnerabilities to common-cause failure (CCF). If the defence in depth analysis reveals that certain safety functions could be affected by CCF, the design should provide for a diverse backup system to perform the safety functions affected by the CCF.</p>  <p><strong>7.6.1.3 Independence</strong></p>  <p>Means for providing independence include physical separation, functional independence and independence from the effects of data communication errors. Generally a combination of these methods should be applied, to achieve an acceptable level of independence. </p>  <p>Functional independence (such as electrical isolation) should be used, in order to reduce the likelihood of adverse interaction between equipment and components of redundant or connected systems, resulting from normal operation or failure of any component in the systems.</p>  <p>SSCs important to safety should be independent of the effects of an event to which they are required to respond. For example, an event should not cause the failure or loss of a safety system or safety function that is necessary to mitigate the consequences of that event.</p>  <p>Redundant portions of a safety group should be independent from each other, to ensure that the safety group can perform its safety function during (and following) any event that requires that function.</p>  <p>The functional failure of the support features of a safety system should not compromise the independence between redundant portions of a safety system, or between a safety system and a system of lower safety classification.</p>  <p>The potential for harmful interactions between those SSCs important to safety that might be required to operate simultaneously should be evaluated, and the effects of any harmful interactions should be prevented.</p>  <p>In the analysis of the potential for harmful interactions of SSCs important to safety, due account should be taken of physical interconnections, and of the possible effects of one system&#8217;s operation, maloperation or malfunction on the local environmental conditions for other essential systems. This would ensure that changes in environmental conditions do not affect the reliability of systems or components while functioning as intended.</p>  <h5>Additional information</h5>  <p>Further information is available in:</p>  <ul>

The integrated effect of all exceptions should not significantly degrade safety; in particular, defence in depth should be preserved.</p>  <p>For passive components that are exempt from the SFC, the following should be considered in order to demonstrate a high degree of performance assurance:</p>  <ul>
<li> adequate testing during the manufacturing stage</li>
<li> sample testing from those components received from the manufacturer</li>
<li> adequate testing during construction and commissioning stages</li>
<li> necessary testing to verify their reliability after the components have been removed from service during the operation stage</li>  </ul>  <p>Any consideration for an exception to the SFC during testing and maintenance should fall into one of the following permissible categories:</p>  <ul>
<li> the safety function is provided by two redundant, independent systems (e.g., two redundant, fully effective, independent cooling means)</li>
<li> the expected duration of testing and maintenance is shorter than the time available before the function is required following an initiating event (e.g., spent fuel storage pool cooling)</li>
<li> the loss of safety function is partial and unlikely to lead to significant increase in consequences even in the event of failure (e.g., small area containment isolation)</li>
<li> the loss of system redundancy has minor safety significance (e.g., control room air filtering)</li>
<li> the loss of system redundancy may slightly increase PIE frequency, but does not impact accident progression (e.g., leak detection)</li>  </ul>  <p>A request for an exception during testing and maintenance should also be supported by a satisfactory reliability argument, covering the allowable outage time.</p>  <p>The OLCs should clearly state the allowable testing and maintenance time, along with any additional operational restrictions, such as suspension of additional testing or maintenance on a backup system for the duration of the exception.</p>  <h5>Additional information</h5>  <p>Further information is available in:</p>  <ul>

<h3><a name="P784_73398" id="P784_73398"></a>7.7 Pressure-retaining SSCs</h3>  <p>For the design of pressure-retaining systems and components, the design authority should ensure that the selection of codes and standards is adequate to provide confidence that plant failures are minimized. This is achieved by using industry standards &#8211; such as CSA N285.0-08, <em>General</em> <em>requirements for pressure-retaining systems and components in CANDU nuclear power plants</em> and <em>ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code</em> &#8211; to meet the requirements of different classes of pressure-retaining systems, components, piping and their supports. Alternative codes and standards may be used, if this would result in an equivalent or superior level of safety; justifications should be provided in such cases.</p>  <p>The design should make provisions to limit stresses and deformation of SSCs important to safety during and after PIEs. The list of PIEs should be comprehensive, and the loads generated by them should be included in the design analysis. The loads generated by these PIEs should be included in the stress analyses required by the design.</p>  <p>As stated in RD-337 version 2<em>,</em> &#8220;<em>the design shall minimize the likelihood of flaws in pressure boundaries&#8221;.</em> For example, the reactor coolant pressure boundary should be designed with sufficient margin to ensure that, under all operating configurations, the material selected will behave in a non-brittle manner and minimize the probability of rapidly propagating fractures.</p>  <p>The pressure boundary components in a NPP almost invariably contain process fluids at very high temperature and pressure. The design should take into account the location of high-energy lines in relation to SSCs important to safety, in order to limit or reduce pipe whip concerns. This includes consideration of:</p>  <ul>
<li> components in the means of shutdown</li>
<li> main coolant pumps</li>
<li> headers</li>
<li> emergency core cooling system (ECCS) piping</li>
<li> steam generators</li>
<li> steam lines</li>
<li> turbine</li>  </ul>  <h5>Leak-before-break</h5>  <p>A qualified leak-before-break (LBB) system design will permit the design authority to optimize protective hardware &#8211; such as pipe whip restraints and jet impingement barriers &#8211; and to redesign pipe-connected components, their supports and their internals.</p>  <p>A qualified LBB methodology should include the following:</p>  <ul>
<li> LBB should be only applied to high energy, ASME Code Class 1 or 2 piping or the equivalent. Applications to other high energy piping may be performed based on an evaluation of the proposed design and in-service inspection requirements.</li>
<li> No active degradation mechanism should exist in the piping system to be qualified for LBB.</li>
<li> An evaluation of phenomena such as the water hammer, creep damage, flow accelerated corrosion and fatigue should be performed to cover the entire life of the high energy piping systems. To demonstrate that water hammer is not a significant contributor to pipe rupture, reliance on historical frequencies of water hammer events in specific piping systems coupled with reviews of operating procedures and conditions may be used for this evaluation.</li>
<li>Leak detection methods for the reactor coolant should ensure that adequate detection margins exist for the postulated through-wall flaw used in the deterministic fracture mechanics evaluation. The margins should cover uncertainties in the determination of leakage from a piping system.</li>
<li> Stress analyses of the piping that is considered for LBB should be in accordance with the requirements of Section III of the ASME code. </li>
<li> The LBB evaluation should use design basis loads and, after construction, be updated to use the as-built piping configuration, as opposed to the design configuration.</li>
<li> The methodology should take account of potential for degradation by erosion, corrosion, and erosion/cavitation due to unfavourable flow conditions and water chemistry.</li>
<li> The methodology should take account of material susceptibility to corrosion, the potential for high residual stresses, and environmental conditions that could lead to degradation by stress corrosion cracking.</li>  </ul>  <p>In addition, leak detection methods for the reactor coolant should be examined, so as to ensure that adequate detection margins exist for the postulated through-wall flaw used in the deterministic fracture mechanics evaluation. </p>  <h5>Finite element methods</h5>  <p>The design authority customarily uses finite element methods to show that all of the pressure boundary components (both vessels and piping) meet the structural integrity requirements imposed by applicable design codes and standards. When finite element methods are used for design analyses covering all ASME class components, the following parameters should be provided:</p>  <ul>
<li> finite element modelling and analysis assumptions are checked, to make sure they are judicious and conservative</li>
<li> finite element mesh is properly refined, to account for geometric structural discontinuities with proper element shapes and aspect ratios</li>
<li> loads and boundary conditions are correct, and properly applied in the finite element models</li>
<li> load combinations and scale factors applied to unit load cases conform to design/load specifications</li>
<li> linearized stress results, obtained from load combinations, are compared with ASME code allowable limits</li>  </ul>  <a name="7.8"></a>
<h3><a name="P818_78593" id="P818_78593"></a>7.8 Equipment environmental qualification </h3>  <p>The designer should provide detailed guidance for an equipment environmental qualification (EQ) program, for qualifying safety-related equipment associated with systems that are essential to perform the credited safety functions defined in RD-337 version 2. The EQ program should address qualification criteria and methods used, and all anticipated environmental conditions upon which the qualification of the equipment (mechanical, electrical, I&amp;C and certain post accident monitoring) is based. </p>  <p>The designer identifies the EQ-related standards and codes (e.g., CSA, IEEE, ASME). The latest editions of the applicable standards for use in the equipment qualification will be preferred; any deviations should be justified.</p>  <p>As a minimum, the basic EQ program elements should be provided as described below.</p>  <h4><a name="P822_79439" id="P822_79439"></a>7.8.1 Identification of equipment requiring harsh environmental qualification</h4>  <p>The design should identify:</p>  <ul>
<li> systems and equipment required to perform safety functions in a harsh environment, including their safety functions and applicable DBAs</li>
<li> non-safety-related equipment whose failure due to harsh post-accident environment could prevent safety-related equipment from accomplishing its safety function</li>
<li> accident monitoring equipment</li>  </ul>  <h4><a name="P827_79878" id="P827_79878"></a>7.8.2 Identification of equipment service conditions</h4>  <p>Service conditions should be identified, to determine required qualification methods as they apply to various types of qualification (e.g., harsh environments, mild environments, radiation-only harsh environments). </p>  <p>The design should provide for:</p>  <ul>
<li> a distinction between mild and harsh environments (e.g., specific criteria to define plant environments as either mild or harsh)</li>
<li> a list of bounding harsh DBAs for qualification of equipment </li>
<li> the environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, radiation, humidity, steam, chemicals, submergence) for each applicable DBA to which equipment is exposed in various plant locations</li>
<li> temperature, pressure and radiation profiles for harsh environment qualification</li>
<li> typical equipment mission time during DBAs </li>
<li> mild environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, humidity, radiation) for operational states, including the assumed duration of the AOOs to which equipment is exposed in various plant locations</li>  </ul>  <h4><a name="P836_80906" id="P836_80906"></a>7.8.3 Qualification methods</h4>  <p>The design should describe methods used to demonstrate the performance of safety-related equipment when subjected to a range of environmental conditions during operational states or DBAs. The methods should determine whether equipment should be qualified for mild or harsh environments. </p>  <p>For harsh environment qualification, the design should include the following: </p>  <ul>
<li> for equipment and components located in a DBA harsh environment, type tests are the preferred method (particularly for electrical equipment) over other methods of qualification; where type tests are not feasible, justification by analysis or operating experience (or a combination of both) may be used </li>
<li> equipment should be reviewed in terms of design, function, materials and environment, to identify significant aging mechanisms caused by operational and environmental conditions occurring during normal operation; where a significant aging mechanism is identified, that aging should be taken into account in the equipment qualification</li>
<li> the qualification should systematically address the sequence of age conditioning, including sequential, simultaneous, synergistic effects, and the method for accelerating radiation degradation effects </li>
<li> appropriate margins, as given in EQ-related standards, should be applied to the specified environmental conditions</li>
<li> for certain equipment (e.g., digital I&amp;C equipment, and new advanced analog electronics) additional environmental conditions &#8211; such as electromagnetic interference (EMI), radio frequency interference (RFI), and power surges &#8211; should be addressed</li>
</ul>
For mild environment qualification, the design should include the following:
<ul>
<li> equipment located in a mild environment may be considered qualified, provided that the environmental conditions are specified in a design specification, and that the manufacturer provides certification that the equipment meets the specification</li>  </ul>  <h4><a name="P847_82842" id="P847_82842"></a>7.8.4 Equipment and instrumentation assessment under DECs </h4>  <p>A demonstration of equipment and instrumentation operability should include the following:</p>  <ul>
<li> the functions credited in the accident timeframes that need to be performed to achieve a safe shutdown state for DECs</li>
<li> the accident timeframes for each function</li>
<li> the equipment type and location used to perform necessary functions in each timeframe</li>
<li> the bounding harsh environment of DECs within each timeframe</li>
<li> a reasonable assurance that the equipment will survive to perform its function in the accident timeframes, in the DEC environment</li>  </ul>  <h4><a name="P854_83442" id="P854_83442"></a>7.8.5 Protective barriers</h4>  <p>The design should address protective barriers, if applicable. When protective barriers are designed to isolate equipment from possible harsh environmental conditions, the barriers themselves should be addressed in a qualification program. Examples of protective barriers include:</p>  <ul>
<li> steam protected rooms and enclosures</li>
<li> steam doors</li>
<li> water protected rooms (for flooding)</li>  </ul>  <h5>Additional information</h5>  <p>Further information is available in: </p>  <ul>

It should extend to the monitoring of radiation, hydrogen, seismic, loose parts, vibration, and fatigue.</p>  <p>The measurements should include continuous and discrete plant variables. Detection and testing should also consider failure, degradation, unsafe conditions, deviation from specified limits, operator errors, and self-diagnosis. Correction of invalid, inauthentic and corrupted functions or data should be applied, to maintain the reliability of systems.</p>  <p>As stated in RD-337 version 2<em>, </em>&#8220;<em>the design shall be such that the safety systems and any necessary support systems can be reliably and independently operated, either automatically or manually, when necessary&#8221;.</em> There should be a bumpless transfer between automatic and manual modes. </p>  <p>Once safety systems&nbsp;are initiated, the reset of safety system functions should require separate operator actions for each system-level function.

<h3><a name="P1007_101241" id="P1007_101241"></a>7.13 Seismic qualification </h3>  <h4><a name="P1008_101268" id="P1008_101268"></a>7.13.1 Seismic design and classification </h4>  <p>The seismic design of a NPP should account for:</p>  <ul>
<li> technical safety objectives and corresponding load categories</li>
<li> seismic input motion</li>
<li> seismic classification </li>
<li> structural layout criteria</li>
<li> seismic analysis and design of structural systems, subsystems and equipment</li>
<li> seismic testing and instrumentation</li>  </ul>  <p>Design and beyond design load categories are defined to demonstrate structural performance in operational states and accident conditions. Earthquake load is not part of the normal load category corresponding to normal operation. Site design earthquake load, according to the CSA N289 series on seismic design and qualification, is defined under the severe load category corresponding to AOO. Design basis earthquake is defined as a part of the abnormal/extreme load category corresponding to DBA. Beyond design basis earthquake load should be considered under DECs. </p>  <p>Seismic input motion, derived from the design basis earthquake, should be based on seismicity and geologic conditions at the site and expressed in such a manner that it can be applied for the qualification of SSCs. Design basis earthquake response spectrum should be defined taking into account a design factor applied to a mean uniform hazard spectrum (with a probability of occurrence of 10<sup>-4</sup>/yr as defined in the standard ASCE 43-05, <em>Seismic Design Criteria for Structures, Systems and Components in Nuclear Facilities</em>). (The probability of occurrence of the loading thus defined is equivalent to the probability of the loading due to DBAs). A minimum seismic input motion, consistent with national or international standards, should be considered in the design phase for the design basis earthquake. The minimum seismic input motion should take into account frequencies of interest for SSCs.</p>  <p>Structural layout criteria, including structural separation, should follow best engineering practices and lessons learned from past earthquakes.</p>  <p>Modelling of soil-structure interaction (SSI) should be based on geotechnical investigation and taking into account the random nature of soil material properties and inherent uncertainties incorporated in soil constitutive models used in the analysis. To account for uncertainties in soil properties a range with at least three values (upper limit, best estimate and lower limit) should be taken into account in the analysis according to CSA N289.3-10, <em>Design procedures for seismic qualification of nuclear power plants,</em> clause 5.2.2.</p>  <p>The analysis of SSI should take into account all effects due to kinematic interaction (effect of applied seismic ground motion on massless structure) and inertial interaction (inertial forces developed in the structure due to the seismic ground motion). The detail and sophistication of soil-structure models should be in accordance with the purposes of the analyses. The frequency range of interest determines aspects of the structure model and the SSI model parameters.</p>  <p>The frequency range of interest should be based on the combination of the frequency range of the earthquake input, the soil properties, the frequency range of building response (including response of subsystems modelled in the main building or structure model), and the frequency range of the response parameter of interest. Refined finite element meshes and increased analytical rigor are required to transmit higher frequencies through the analytical models.</p>  <p>Damping ratios for structural systems and sub-systems should be taken into account according to ASCE 43-05. For generating the in-structure response spectra to be used as input to the structure mounted systems and components, Response Level 1 damping of the structure is more appropriate unless the structure response generally exceeds demand over capacity factor given in ASCE 43-05.</p>  <p>The seismic design of structural systems should be according to seismic design category (SDC) 1 to 5 as per ASCE 43-05. </p>  <p>SDC 1 and 2 structural systems should be in accordance with <em>National Building Code of Canada, </em>Division B, Part 4. According to the Code, SDC 1 should be as normal and SDC 2 as post-disaster.</p>  <p>All structures important to safety are classified as SDC 5. However, the designer may still classify some structures as SDC 3, 4 and 5 provided that they include proper justification. Guidance on SDC 3, 4 and 5 (if SDC 3 and 4 are used) structural systems are provided as follows:</p>  <ul>
<li> for concrete containment, the design should be based on the American Society of Civil Engineers, ASCE 43-05 (SDC 5, limit state D) and CSA N287.3-93, <em>Design Requirements for Concrete Containment Structures for CANDU Nuclear Power Plants</em></li>
<li> for steel containment, the design should be based on ASCE 43-05 (SDC 5), 2010 <em>ASME</em> <em>Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code</em>, Section III: Rules for Construction of Nuclear Power Plant Components, Division 1, Subsection NE: Class MC Components and U.S. NRC Regulatory Guide 1.57, <em>Design Limits and Loading Combinations for Metal Primary Reactor Containment System Components</em></li>
<li> for concrete and steel safety related structures the design should be based on ASCE 43-05 (SDC 5, limit state D) and CSA N291-08, <em>Requirements for Safety-Related Structures for CANDU Nuclear Power Plants</em></li>  </ul>  <p>For all safety design categories in a NPP, ductility requirements should be in accordance with CSA-A23.3-04 (R2010), <em>Design of Concrete Structures</em> for concrete structures and CSA S16-09, <em>Design of Steel Structures</em>&nbsp;for steel structures assuming that the structures are ductile or type D. These ductility requirements should provide margins for the beyond design basis earthquake.</p>  <p>Sub-system analysis should follow the guidance presented for structural systems with the following criteria specific to sub-system supports:</p>  <ul>
<li> in-structure response spectra</li>
<li> in-structure time response histories</li>  </ul>  <p>The methods of defining in-structure response spectra or in-structure time-histories as well as application of this seismic input to sub-systems and components should be in accordance with ASCE 04, <em>Seismic Analysis for Safety-Related Nuclear Structures</em>.</p>  <p>Multiple support seismic input of sub-systems and components should take into account their inertial and kinematic components. The analysis should follow ASCE 04 or CSA N289.3-10, <em>Design procedures for seismic qualification of nuclear power plants. </em></p>  <p>Determination of the number of earthquake cycles for sub-system analysis should be in accordance with U.S. NRC NUREG-0800, Standard Review Plan, section 3.7.3,<em> Seismic Subsystem Analysis</em> as well as seismic analysis of above-ground tanks. </p>  <p>Seismic design of sub-systems and components should be in accordance with ASCE 43-05 section 8.2.3 which follows ASME Code.</p>  <p>For equipment qualified by testing, multi-axis, multi-frequency testing is acceptable for the design basis earthquake in accordance with the requirement of IEEE 344-2004 &#8211; <em>IEEE Recommended Practice for Seismic Qualification of Class 1E Equipment for Nuclear Power</em> <em>Generating Stations</em> and that the testing response spectrum should be at least a factor of 1.4 times the required response spectrum throughout the frequency range. Any deviation from this should be conservatively justified on a case by case basis. </p>  <p>Any evaluation for beyond design basis earthquake should utilize the methodology in the Electrical Power Research Institute, (EPRI) TR-103959, <em>Methodology for Developing Seismic Fragilities </em>to determine if a high confidence low probability of failure (HCLPF) goal is met. </p>  <p>Seismic instrumentation design should follow CSA-N289.5-M91 (R2008) <em>Seismic</em>, <em>Instrumentation Requirements for CANDU Nuclear Power Plants</em> which itemizes the requirements for single and multi-unit site seismic instrumentation.</p>  <p>Beyond design basis margin should be such that seismically induced SSC failure probabilities do not contribute to the total core damage frequency and small and large release frequency to the extent that they do not meet the safety goals. The acceptance criteria for beyond design basis earthquake should be: </p>  <ul>
<li> a plant level HCLPF being at least 1.67 times the design basis earthquake</li>
<li> the containment integrity in the case of beyond design basis earthquake</li>  </ul>  <p>Assessment and validation of margins for beyond design basis earthquake should be considered, including the metric HCLPF. </p>  <p>The seismic isolation of SSCs is an acceptable design approach to limit seismic demand. Seismic isolation devices should be designed, manufactured and installed to withstand a seismic action defined by a design basis earthquake without any failure, preserving its mechanical resistance and full load bearing capacity during and after the earthquake. Moreover, the devices and the whole structural system should be designed to withstand beyond design basis earthquake up to 2 times the spectral accelerations of the design basis earthquake without major damages and preserving its function (without experiencing cliff-edge effect). It includes the provisions to accommodate the structural displacements up to 2 times the displacements under design basis earthquake conditions.</p>  <h5>Additional information</h5>  <p>Further information is available in:</p>  <ul>

In particular, the reactor core should be designed to permit the implementation of a material surveillance program to monitor the effects of service conditions on material properties throughout the operating life of the reactor.</p>  <p>The design should establish a technical basis of SSCs that require in-service testing, maintenance, repair, inspection and monitoring. </p>  <p>The development of strategies and programs to address in-service testing, maintenance, repair, inspection and monitoring is a necessary aspect of the plant design phase. The strategies and programs that will be implemented for these in-service activities should be developed so as to ensure that plant SSCs remain capable and available to perform their safety functions. The design should incorporate provisions recognizing the need for in-service testing, maintenance, repair, inspection and monitoring, as well as to permit the repair, replacement and modification of those SSCs likely to require such actions, due to anticipated operating conditions. In addition, activities which need to be carried out during the construction and commissioning phases should be identified, in order to provide a meaningful baseline data of the plant, at the outset of its operating life.</p>  <p>The strategies should include well-planned and effective programs for evaluating and trending SSCs performance, coupled with an optimized preventive maintenance program. </p>  <p>The strategies and programs should demonstrate consideration of the following:</p>  <ul>

<li> the requirements of applicable codes, standards and regulations</li>
<li> the responsibilities of the designer, vendor, constructor, operating organization and contractors</li>

<h3><a name="P1211_128743" id="P1211_128743"></a>7.21 Human factors </h3>  <p>This section applies to the design of all plant systems where there are human factors (HF) considerations. Human factors means &#8220;factors that influence human performance&#8221;, as defined in CNSC P-119 <em>Policy on Human Factors</em>. In practice, it is expected that most plant systems will require some consideration of HF.</p>  <p>The systematic approaches and processes taken for HF in design should meet international standards and good practices. HF codes and standards that are used by the design authority for the plant design should be identified and evaluated for their suitability, applicability, sufficiency and adequacy. </p>  <p>There should be sufficient authority in the management of HF in design to ensure that HF considerations that influence safety are adequately taken into account. HF design requirements that will supplement the codes (e.g., concerning usability and human performance) should also be identified and specified early in the design stage process.</p>  <p>The following areas should have interfaces with HF in design:</p>  <ul>
<li> engineering design of specific SSCs</li>
<li> procedure development</li>
<li> training development</li>
<li> consideration of human actions in safety analyses</li>
<li> specifications of staffing and minimum shift complement</li>  </ul>  <p>The design expectations are provided below for use in different design stages.</p>  <h5>Planning</h5>  <p>A human factors engineering program plan (HFEPP) demonstrates how HF considerations are incorporated into the design activities. Further guidance on how to develop such a plan is provided in the CNSC G-276 <em>Human Factors Engineering Program Plans</em> and U.S. NRC NUREG-0711, Revision 2, <em>Human Factors Engineering Program Review Model</em>. The technical elements described in the plan should be supported by subsequent verification and validation activities for the resulting design, as described in CNSC G-278 <em>Human Factors Verification and Validation Plans</em>.</p>  <p>The HF in design activities is effectively integrated in the overall engineering design process and incorporated early enough to make an effective contribution to safety. There should be a sufficient number of trained, qualified and experienced HF specialists to carry out the HF in design activities.</p>  <h5>Analysis</h5>  <p>Systematic analytical approaches are used to establish the HF inputs. Such analyses should be conducted from the earliest stages of design, to provide a strong foundation upon which the design solutions are based. The specific HF analyses should be:</p>  <ul>
<li> appropriate to the activities in question that they cover, considering the risk of the activities and the novelty of the design</li>
<li> carried out throughout the development of the design</li>
<li> use methods, techniques, and good practices that are considered acceptable by trained and experienced human factors specialists</li>
<li> share the information produced between groups engaged in different parts of the design</li>  </ul>  <p>The HF analyses could include:</p>  <ul>
<li> function analysis </li>
<li> task analysis </li>
<li> human reliability analysis</li>
<li> hazard analysis</li>
<li> link analysis </li>
<li> information requirements analysis</li>
<li> staffing analysis</li>
<li> usability analysis</li>
<li> operability and maintainability analysis</li>  </ul>  <p>The design should also provide research or study reports for any work carried out as part of the process of developing and testing any new human-system interface technologies (i.e., displays and controls) that are new to NPP applications and that may have a bearing on safety.</p>  <p>The design should demonstrate that steps have been taken in developing the design to reduce or eliminate, where practicable, the potential for human error; that there are acceptable means by which to identify error; that methods are provided by which to recover from the error; and that the consequences of error can be mitigated. </p>  <h5>Design</h5>  <p>There should be evidence that a systematic process exists for the design of work areas, work environments, and human-system interfaces for SSCs throughout the plant. The design should demonstrate consideration of HF issues for all aspects of the plant, not just control areas. HF aspects should be considered where off-the-shelf SSCs are specified and procured. Operating experience concerning HF issues gained from existing or similar systems should be considered in the design. </p>  <p>A significant aspect of this systematic process is the use of modern human factors codes, standards, and good practices in developing the design. Guidance is provided in U.S. NRC NUREG-0700 Revision 2, <em>Human-System Interface Design Review Guidelines</em>. </p>  <p>The design should demonstrate that operators (and any other potential users) in the main control room, the secondary control room, the emergency support centre, and in the plant, are provided with the necessary and appropriate information in a format that is compatible with necessary decision and action times. The same kind of considerations should apply to other users of equipment (e.g., maintainers and technicians) elsewhere in the plant.</p>  <h5>Operating personnel</h5>  <p>Personnel who have operating experience from similar plants should be actively involved in the design process, to ensure that consideration is given, as early as possible to the future operation and maintenance of the SSCs.</p>  <p>Formal interfaces should be defined between the HF in design group(s) and the various design engineering groups involved in the design process; this facilitates the interactions and sharing of information to achieve good integration of HF considerations in the design.</p>  <h5>Verification and validation </h5>  <p>Evaluations are an essential part of HF in the design process and include both verification and validation activities. Evaluation criteria (i.e., design requirements and standards) should be established prior to conducting these evaluations.</p>  <p>HF verification activities should be carried out (generally by vendor and licensee) to confirm that the design conforms to HF design standards and has been implemented as intended in the plant. </p>  <p>Validations should be carried out iteratively at various stages of the design process, ensuring that the task fidelity is appropriate. Data from the validation activities should be analysed and the results should be used to improve the design. Validation should confirm that the system, including the human components and procedures to support the tasks, meets the specified system and usability requirements. Validations should also demonstrate that operations and maintenance personnel can successfully carry out their tasks in a safe manner. </p>  <p>Guidance on evaluations is provided in CNSC G-278, <em>Human Factors Verification and Validation Plans</em>, and U.S. NRC NUREG-6393, <em>Integrated System Validation: Methodology and Review Criteria.</em></p>  <h5>Additional information</h5>  <p>Further information is available in: </p>  <ul>

<h3><a name="P1304_137134" id="P1304_137134"></a>7.22 Robustness against malevolent acts</h3>  <p>The engineering safety aspects of robustness and protection from malevolent acts should account for:</p>  <ul>
<li> basic design approach</li>
<li> structural performance objectives</li>
<li> threat characterisation</li>
<li> loading development</li>
<li> material properties</li>
<li> principles of analysis and design</li>
<li> structural acceptance criteria</li>
<li> design of SSCs</li>  </ul>  <p>The basis for identifying malevolent acts considered in the design is the potential to cause a release of radioactivity to the public and the environment. </p>  <h4><a name="P1316_137652" id="P1316_137652"></a>7.22.1 Design principles</h4>  <p>The identification of vital areas involves the identification and location of SSCs that require protection, in order to prevent unacceptable radiological consequences. The design includes the reactor building and the spent fuel pool, including the structure housing the spent fuel pool. The protection measures for these identified vital areas should be assessed. </p>  <p>Based on identified threats, definition and development of the design basis threat (DBT) and beyond design basis threat (BDBT) sets of load cases should be selected. Each load case should be selected as the worst case scenario for a given threat.</p>  <h4><a name="P1320_138286" id="P1320_138286"></a>7.22.2 Design methods</h4>  <p>Vital areas are designed according to the tiered approach related to the level of the threat.  For the loadings induced by DBT, the structural design methodology applies conservative design measures and sound engineering practices that meet codes and standards.</p>  <p>For more severe events, the first tier BDBT, sufficient structural integrity to protect important systems is provided. The design code criteria may be relaxed; however, the design methodology is followed.</p>  <p>For extreme events, the second tier BDBT, degradation of the containment barrier may be accepted; however, the degradation is limited. The structures of vital areas are designed for the second tier BDBT that may exceed design code limits but within documented material and structural limits.</p>  <p>The aircraft crash loading functions related to DBTs and BDBTs are &#8220;classified&#8221;, and are available to licensees and applicants upon request to the CNSC. </p>  <p>It is acceptable to model the whole aircraft as a load that impacts the structure. However, the design should be such that the loading functions due to the crash of the modelled aircraft against a rigid target envelope are acceptable. </p>  <p>Two distinct types of structural failure modes need to be reviewed: local (punching - brittle) failure and global (flexural - plastic) failure. The loading characteristics and structural behaviour for these two failure modes are different, and should be reviewed separately. However, it should be noted that, in some cases, these two failure modes (e.g., an aircraft crash) may act simultaneously or quasi-simultaneously.</p>  <p>Local structural behaviours under a malevolent-act-induced loading case should be assessed. Local damage to the target can be defined using the following descriptions:</p>  <ul>
<li> penetration &#8211; the depth of the crater due to the missile impact</li>
<li> spalling &#8211; the ejection of the target material from the front face of the target (impacted face)</li>
<li> scabbing &#8211; the ejection of material from the rear face of the target</li>
<li> just perforation &#8211; the missile just penetrates the target with residual velocity equal to zero </li>  </ul>  <p>Most technical references consider engines, in the case of an aircraft crash, as the critical missiles.  Such local damage modes would not, in general, result in structural collapse; but they can cause damage to safety-related systems or components. Application of empirical formulae for perforation and scabbing is an acceptable approach to assess structural behaviour under local, concentrated loading. </p>  <p>Global structural response effects refer to the overall building behaviour in response to the applied impact loading. The global response can be characterized by major structural damage, such as significant perforation or collapse of large portions of the building walls, floors, and load carrying frames. The impact could also potentially induce significant vibrations or &#8220;shock loading&#8221; throughout the building.</p>  <p>In the case of an aircraft crash, local damage associated with the impact of a missile into the wall may result in scabbing of concrete from the rear face. Ultimately, it may result in local fracture of rebar, allowing perforation of the wall by the residual crushed engine mass and remaining portion of the shaft. Global structural damage, however, is generally associated with the deformation of the entire structural system.</p>  <p>The design of the facility&#8217;s physical protection system should consider changes in threat, enhanced understanding of the potential vulnerabilities of the facility, its systems and structures as well as advances in physical protection approaches, systems, and technologies.</p>  <h4><a name="P1348_141908" id="P1348_141908"></a>7.22.3 Acceptance criteria</h4>  <p>The acceptance criteria for both local and global behaviour should be satisfied simultaneously.</p>  <p>The structural acceptance criteria for local behaviour should include the following:</p>  <ul>
<li> DBT &#8211; no scabbing of the rear face of structural elements, possibly with limited, superficial spalling of concrete, easily repairable</li>
<li> severe BDBTs &#8211; no scabbing of the rear face of structural element, or possible limited scabbing (concrete cover), if confined by the steel liner. The steel liner should remain leak-tight</li>
<li> extreme BDBTs &#8211; no perforation, according to the applicable formula with a corresponding increase factor of 1.2 applied to the calculated thickness</li>  </ul>  <p>Detailed structural analyses of representative containment structures indicate that large displacements of the containment would be expected as well as induced vibrations. The structural acceptance criteria for global behaviour are related to the limitation of structural deflections (DBT and severe BDBT) or overall damage (extreme BDBT). Therefore, special attention should be given to: </p>  <ul>
<li> damage to the internal structures and to the containment due to extensive deformations of the containment building</li>
<li> shock damage to fragile components directly attached to the containment wall</li>
<li> induced vibration</li>
<li> structural integrity of the reserve water tank (e.g., CANDU design)</li>
<li> structural integrity of the polar crane</li>  </ul>  <p>Structural acceptance criteria for reinforced concrete elements are given in Table 1. </p>  <p>Acceptance criteria for steel are given in Table 2.</p>  <table className="table table-striped">

<h3><a name="P1600_155259" id="P1600_155259"></a>7.23 Safeguards </h3>  <p>For the purposes of this document, the term &#8220;safeguards&#8221; denotes a system of inspection and other verification activities undertaken by IAEA in order to evaluate a state&#8217;s compliance with its obligations, pursuant to its safeguards agreement with the IAEA, under the <em>Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons</em>. The objective of the Canada-IAEA safeguards agreement is for the IAEA to provide annual assurance to Canada and to the international community that all declared nuclear material is employed in peaceful, non-explosive uses, and that there is no indication of undeclared nuclear material or activities. The CNSC is the governmental authority responsible for implementing the Canada-IAEA safeguards agreement.</p>  <p>The integration of safeguards considerations during the early design phase of a new NPP is a well established practice in the Canadian nuclear industry. This approach can avoid the retrofitting of safeguards equipment after a design is completed, which could otherwise result in substantial cost increases in terms of redesign work, timeline extensions and additional demands on human resources. If there is a requirement to install IAEA safeguards equipment to monitor nuclear material flows and inventories, accurate plant layout requirements should be identified early in the process, so as to ensure that appropriate &#8220;design space&#8221; is allocated for critical safeguards installations. </p>  <p>The CNSC requires that licensees put in place a program and appropriate procedures to ensure that safeguards can be implemented effectively and in a manner consistent with Canada&#8217;s obligations. </p>  <h5>Additional information</h5>  <p>Further information is available in:</p>  <ul>

<h2><a name="P1623_158301" id="P1623_158301"></a>8.0 Guidance on System-Specific Requirements</h2>  <h3><a name="P1624_158345" id="P1624_158345"></a>8.1 Reactor core </h3>  <p>The design of the reactor core should provide confidence that the permissible design limits, under operational states and accident conditions, are not exceeded, taking into account engineering tolerances and uncertainties associated with the calculations. </p>  <p><strong>8.1.0.1 Nuclear design</strong></p>  <p>The nuclear design deals with flux and power distribution within the reactor core, the design and use of reactivity control systems for normal operation and for shutting down the reactor, core stability, the various reactivity feedback characteristics, and the physics of the fuel.</p>  <h5>General expectations</h5>  <p>The reactor core design should take into account all practical means so that, in the power operating range, the net effect of the prompt inherent nuclear feedback characteristics tends to compensate for a rapid increase in reactivity and power. The consequences of those accidents that would be aggravated by a positive reactivity feedback should be either acceptable, or be satisfactorily mitigated by other design features.</p>  <p>The design should take into account measurements made in previous reactors and critical experiments and their use in the uncertainty analyses, and the measurements to be made, including startup confirmatory tests and periodically required measurements.</p>  <p>The design should provide for I&amp;C to:</p>  <ul>
<li> maintain the variables and systems within prescribed operating ranges </li>
<li> monitor variables and systems that can affect the fission process over anticipated ranges for operational states and accident conditions</li>  </ul>  <p>These I&amp;Cs should be demonstrated to be effective.</p>  <h5>Defence in depth</h5>  <p>The nuclear design should incorporate inherently safe features to reduce the reliance on engineered safety systems or operational procedures. Defence in depth and related principles should be applied in the design of the reactivity control safety function, such that the fission chain reaction is controlled during operational states, and, when necessary, terminated for accident conditions. </p>  <p>The nuclear design should provide for effective means to ensure success of the following safety functions to:</p>  <ul>
<li> prevent unacceptable reactivity transients</li>
<li> shut down the reactor as necessary to prevent progression of AOOs to DBAs, or DBAs to DECs</li>
<li> maintain and monitor the reactor in a safe shutdown state</li>  </ul>  <h5>Core power densities and distributions</h5>  <p>The design limits for the power densities and power distributions should be determined from an integrated consideration of fuel design limits, thermal limits, decay heat limits, and AOO and accident analyses. For power distribution, the reactor core design should demonstrate the following:</p>
<p>a) There is a high level of confidence that the proposed design limits can be met within the expected operational range of the reactor, taking into account:  <ul>
<li>the analytical methods and data for the design calculations</li>
<li>uncertainty analyses and experimental comparisons presented for the design calculations</li>
<li> the sufficiency of design cases calculated covering times in fuel reload cycle, or during on-power fuelling (depending upon the reactor design, reactivity devices configurations, and load-follow transients)</li>
<li> special problems (such as power spikes due to densification), possible asymmetries, and misaligned reactivity devices</li>  </ul>  b) There is a high level of confidence that, during normal operation, the design limits will not be exceeded, based on consideration of information received from the power distribution monitoring instrumentation. The processing of that information should include:  <ul>
<li> calculations (instrument-calculation correlations) involved in the processing </li>
<li> operating procedures used</li>
<li> the requirements for periodic check measurements</li>
<li> the accuracy of design calculations used in developing correlations when primary variables are not directly measured </li>
<li> the uncertainty analyses for the information and processing system</li>
<li> the requirements for instruments, the calibration and calculations involved in their use, and the uncertainties involved in conversion of instrument readings into power distribution</li>
<li> the limits and setpoints for control actions, alarms, or automatic trip for instrument systems and demonstration that these systems can maintain the reactor within design power distribution limits (including the instrumentation alarms for the limits of normal operation (e.g., offset limits, control bank limits) and for abnormal situations (e.g., flux tilt alarms)</li>
<li> measurements in previous reactors and critical experiments, including their use in the uncertainty analyses</li>
<li> measurements needed for startup confirmatory tests and the required periodical measurements</li>  </ul></p>
<p>The limiting power distributions should be determined such that the limits on power densities and peaking factors can be maintained in operation. These limiting power distributions may be maintained (i.e., not exceeded) administratively (i.e., not by automatic shutdown), provided a suitable demonstration is made that sufficient, properly translated information and alarms are available from the reactor instrumentation to keep the operator informed.</p>  <p>The design should establish the correlation between design power distributions and operating power distributions, including instrument-calculation correlations, operating procedures used, and measurements that will be taken. Necessary limits on these operations should be established.</p>  <p>The breakdown of design power distributions into the following components should be established:</p>  <ul>
<li> power generated in the fuel</li>
<li> power generated directly in the coolant and moderator</li>
<li> power generated directly in the core internals</li>  </ul>  <p>The reference design core power distributions (axial, radial, and local distributions and peaking factors) used in AOO and accident analyses should be established. In addition, power distributions within fuel pins should be established.</p>  <p>The design limits for power densities (and thus for peaking factors) during normal operation should be such that acceptable fuel design limits are not exceeded during AOOs and that other limits are not exceeded during accident conditions. The design limits, along with related uncertainties, operating limits, instrument requirements, and setpoints, should be incorporated into OLCs.</p>  <h5>Reactivity coefficients</h5>  <p>The design should establish and characterize the bounding (conservative) reference values for reactivity coefficients. </p>  <p>The range of plant states to be covered should include the entire operating range &#8211; from cold shutdown through full-power &#8211; and the extremes reached in AOOs and accident conditions. It should include the full range of the fuelling cycle, and an appropriate range of reactivity device configurations.</p>  <p>The design calculations of reactivity coefficients should cover the full applicable range of the variables and modelling approximations in AOO and accident analyses, including approximations related to modelling and nodalization of the reactor cooling system. Where applicable, the difference between intra- and inter-assembly moderator coefficients needs to be established.</p>  <p>Conservatism should be considered based on:</p>  <ul>
<li> the use of a coefficient (i.e., the analyses in which it is important)</li>
<li> whether state of the art tools have been used for calculation of the coefficient</li>
<li> the uncertainty associated with such calculations, experimental checks of the coefficient in operating reactors</li>
<li> any required checks of the coefficient in the startup program following significant core reconfiguration</li>  </ul>  <p>The design calculation should cover and be supported by the following:</p>  <ul>
<li> calculated nominal values for the reactivity coefficients, such as the coolant and moderator coefficients (temperature, void, or density coefficients), the Doppler coefficient and power coefficients</li>
<li> uncertainty analyses for nominal values, including the magnitude of the uncertainty and the justification of the magnitude (by examination of the accuracy of the methods used in calculations), and comparison, where possible, with reactor experiments. For comparisons to experiments, it is important to show that the experiments are applicable and relevant, and the experimental conditions overlap the operating and anticipated accident conditions.</li>
<li> combination of nominal values and uncertainties to provide suitably conservative values for use in reactor steady-state analysis (primarily control requirements), stability analyses, and the AOO and accident analyses</li>  </ul>  <p>The power coefficient of reactivity should be negative, or the design authority should demonstrate that operation with a positive power coefficient is acceptable for certain rare operating states, by showing:</p>  <ul>
<li> a bounding value of power coefficient of reactivity has been calculated for all permitted operating states and used in control, stability, and safety analyses</li>
<li> measurements of the power coefficient of reactivity are conducted at startup and periodically for certain operating limiting core conditions to demonstrate that measured values are bounded by calculated values with adequate margin</li>
<li> the reactor control system is designed with adequate reliability and has the capability to automatically accommodate for a positive power coefficient of reactivity for a wide range of AOOs</li>  </ul>  <p>The design should ensure that the likelihood of exceeding specified criteria of the AOOs without shutdown is sufficiently small, by demonstrating either that the criteria are met, or that a diverse shutdown means is installed, which reduces significantly the probability of a failure to shutdown.</p>  <h5>Criticality</h5>  <p>The nuclear design should ensure that the criticality of the reactor during refuelling is controlled. If on-power refuelling is used to compensate for core reactivity depletion, the nuclear design should establish the values of core excess reactivity, maximum local powers, amount of fuel loaded per refuelling operation and frequency of refuelling load; the design should also ensure that the maximum core excess reactivity and predicted local power peaks will not exceed the control system capability and fuel thermal limits. </p>  <h5>Core stability</h5>  <p>Power oscillations that could result in conditions exceeding specified acceptable fuel design limits should not be possible, or should be reliably and readily detected and suppressed.</p>  <p>Assessment of reactor core stability should include:</p>  <ul>
<li> phenomena and reactor aspects that influence the stability of the nuclear reactor core</li>
<li> calculations and considerations given to xenon-induced spatial oscillations</li>
<li> potential stability issues, due to other phenomena or conditions</li>
<li> verification of the analytical methods for comparison with measured data</li>  </ul>  <h5>Analytical methods</h5>  <p>The analytical methods and database used for nuclear design and reactor physics analyses should be consistent with modern best practices. Also, the experiments used to validate the analytical methods should be adequate representations of fuel designs in the reactor and ranges of key parameters in the validation database should overlap those expected in design and safety analysis.</p>  <p>The design should be such that the analytical methods used in the nuclear design (including those for predicting criticality, reactivity coefficients, burnup and stability) as well as the database and nuclear data libraries used for neutron cross-section data and other nuclear parameters (including delayed neutron and photo neutron data and other relevant data) are adequate and fit for application, based on adequate qualification. The qualification should be based on proven practices for validation and verification, using the acceptable codes and standards.</p>  <h5>Core internals and vessel</h5>  <p>The nuclear design should establish:</p>  <ul>
<li> neutron flux spectrum above 1 million electron volts (MeV) in the core, at the core boundaries, and at the inside vessel wall, if applicable</li>
<li> assumptions used in the calculations, these include the power level, the use factor, the type of fuel cycle considered, and the design life of the vessel</li>
<li> computer codes used in the analysis</li>
<li> the database for fast neutron cross-sections</li>
<li> the geometric modelling of the reactor core, internals, and vessel(s)</li>
<li> uncertainties in the calculations</li>  </ul>  <h5>Additional information</h5>  <p>Further information is available in:</p>  <ul>

The types of detectors and other devices used in monitoring the core parameters should be described.</p>  <p>The reactor control strategy should be defined, to ensure that the reactor will be restored to an acceptable safe state if any reactor parameter deviates from its allowed domain. The control strategy should be such that fuel integrity will be maintained for all AOOs.</p>  <p>The refuelling scheme should be developed to ensure that the intermediate refuelling configurations do not have more reactivity than the most reactive configuration approved in the design. The core parameters for the intermediate configurations should be within their approved limits.</p>  <p>The design should allow for data acquisition during reactor operation and record-keeping for later retrieval and analysis.</p>  <p>The design should take into account the details of fuel management strategy including the loading of fuel into the fresh core, and the criteria for determining the location of fuel assemblies to be unloaded from the reactor and loaded with fresh fuel.</p>  <p>For reactor designs with batch fuelling, the design should provide for diagnostic tests performed at the beginning of a fuel cycle, so as to verify that the core parameters are within their allowed range.</p>  <p>Important reactivity coefficients and physics parameters should be shown to be within safe limits, as described in the safety analysis.</p>  <p><strong>8.1.0.3 Reactor internals</strong></p>  <p>The reactor internal components designated as ASME Code, Section III,<em> Core Support Structures</em> should be designed, fabricated, and examined in accordance with the provisions of Section III, subsection NG, of the ASME Code.</p>  <p>Those reactor internals components not designated as ASME Code, Section III, <em>Core Support</em> <em>Structures</em> should be designated as internal structures in accordance with ASME Code, Section III, Subsection NG-1122. The design criteria, loading conditions, and analyses that provide the basis for the design of reactor internals (other than the core support structures) should meet the guidelines of ASME Code, Section III, Subsection NG-3000, and constructed so as to not adversely affect the integrity of the core support structures. If other guidelines (e.g., manufacturer standards or empirical methods based on field experience and testing) are the bases for the stress, deformation, and fatigue criteria, those guidelines should be identified and their use justified in the design. </p>  <p>For non-ASME code structures and components, design margins presented for allowable stress, deformation, and fatigue should be equal to or greater than margins for other plants of similar design with successful operating experience. Any decreases in design margins should be justified.</p>  <p>Specific reactor internals components designated as Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3 should be designed, fabricated, and examined in accordance with the applicable codes and standards, such as ASME Section III for light water reactors (LWR), and CSA N285.0, <em>General requirements for pressure-retaining systems and</em> <em>components in CANDU nuclear power plants</em> for CANDU.</p>  <h4><a name="P1745_174995" id="P1745_174995"></a>8.1.1 Fuel elements and assemblies</h4>  <p>The fuel design and qualification should provide assurance that the reactor core design requirements in section 8.1 of RD-337 version 2 are met.</p>  <p><strong>8.1.1.1 Fuel design</strong></p>  <p>Acceptance criteria should be established for fuel damage, fuel rod failure, and fuel coolability. These criteria should be derived from experiments that identify the limitations of the material properties of the fuel and fuel assembly. The fuel design criteria and other design considerations are provided below.</p>  <h5>Fuel damage</h5>  <p>Fuel damage criteria should be included for all known damage mechanisms in normal operation. The damage criteria should assure that fuel dimensions remains within operational tolerances, and that functional capabilities are not reduced below those assumed in the safety analysis. When applicable, the fuel damage criteria should consider high burn-up effects based on irradiated material properties data. The criteria should include stress, strain or loading limits, the cumulative number of strain fatigue cycles, fretting wear, oxidation, hydriding (deuteriding in CANDU reactors), build-up of corrosion products, dimensional changes, rod internal gas pressures, worst-case hydraulic loads, and LWR control rod reactivity and insertability.</p>  <h5>Fuel rod failure</h5>  <p>Fuel rod failure applies to operational states and accident conditions. Fuel rod failure criteria should be provided for all known fuel rod failure mechanisms. The design should ensure that fuel does not fail as a result of specific causes during operational states. Fuel rod failures may occur during accident conditions, and are accounted for in the safety analysis. </p>  <p>The methods used in the assessment of the fuel failure mechanisms, reactor loading and power manoeuvring limitations, and fuel duty which lead to an acceptably low probability of failure, should be stated. When applicable, the fuel rod failure criteria should consider high burnup effects, based on data of irradiated material properties. The criteria should include:</p>  <ul>
<li> hydriding</li>
<li> cladding collapse</li>
<li> cladding overheating </li>
<li> fuel pellet overheating </li>
<li> excessive fuel enthalpy</li>
<li> pellet-clad interaction</li>
<li> stress-corrosion cracking </li>
<li> cladding bursting </li>
<li> mechanical fracturing</li>  </ul>  <h5>Fuel coolability</h5>  <p>Fuel coolability applies to DBAs and, to the extent practicable, DECs. Fuel coolability criteria and LWR control rod insertability criteria should be provided for all damage mechanisms in accident conditions. The fuel should be designed to ensure that fuel rod damage will not interfere with effective emergency core cooling. The cladding temperatures should not reach a temperature high enough to allow a significant metal-water reaction to occur, thereby minimizing the potential for offsite fission product release. The criteria should include cladding embrittlement, violent expulsion of fuel, generalized cladding melting, fuel rod ballooning, structural deformation and, in CANDU, beryllium braze penetration.</p>  <h5>Other design considerations</h5>  <p>The design should also include: </p>  <ul>
<li> all expected fuel handling activities</li>
<li> the effects of post-irradiation fuel assembly handling</li>
<li> cooling flow of other components of LWR fuel assembly (such as control rods, poison rods, instrumentation, or neutron sources)</li>  </ul>  <h5>Fuel testing, inspection, and surveillance programs</h5>  <p>Programs for testing and inspection of new fuel, as well as for online fuel monitoring and post-irradiation surveillance of irradiated fuel should be established.</p>  <h5>Fuel specification</h5>  <p>The design should establish the specification of fuel rods and assembly (including LWR control rods) in order to minimize design deviations and to determine whether all design bases are met (such as limits and tolerances).</p>  <h5>Additional information</h5>  <p>Further information is available in:</p>  <ul>

The design requirements can be demonstrated by meeting a set of derived acceptance criteria (DAC), as required by RD-310, <em>Safety Analysis for Nuclear Power Plants</em>. </p>  <p>Critical heat flux (CHF) is defined as the heat flux at departure from nucleate boiling (DNB), commonly used in pressurized water reactors (PWRs), or at dryout, commonly used in CANDU designs.</p>  <p>It should be noted that, although a thermal margin criterion is sufficient to demonstrate that overheating from a deficient cooling mechanism can be avoided; other mechanistic methods may be acceptable as CHF is not considered as a failure mechanism. In some designs, CHF conditions during transients can be tolerated if it can be shown by other methods that the sheath temperatures do not exceed well-defined acceptable limits. However, any other criteria than the CHF criterion should address sheath temperature, pressure, time duration, oxidation, embrittlement etc., and these new criteria should be supported by sufficient experimental and analytical evidence. In the absence of such evidence, the core thermal-hydraulic design is expected to demonstrate a thermal margin to CHF. </p>  <p>The demonstration of thermal margin is expected to be presented in a manner that accounts for all possible reactor operational states and conditions, as determined from operating maps including all AOOs. The demonstration should also include long term effects of plant aging and other expected changes to core configuration over the operating life of the plant. </p>  <p>The demonstration of thermal margin should thoroughly address uncertainties of various parameters affecting the thermal margin. The design should identify all sources of significant uncertainties that contribute to the uncertainty of thermal margin. The uncertainty for each of the sources should be quantified with supportable evidence.</p>  <p>In addition to the demonstration of thermal margin, the core thermal-hydraulic design should also address possible core power and flow oscillations and thermal-hydraulic instabilities. The design should be such that power and flow oscillations that result in conditions exceeding specified acceptable fuel design limits are not possible or can be reliably and readily detected and suppressed.</p>  <h4><a name="P1795_181609" id="P1795_181609"></a>8.1.2 Control system</h4>  <p>As stated in RD-337 version 2, &#8220;<em>the reactor core control system shall detect and intercept deviations from normal operation, with the goal of preventing AOOs from escalating to accident conditions</em>&#8221;. </p>  <h5>Reactivity control</h5>  <p>The reactivity control should ensure that:</p>  <ul>
<li> the acceptable fuel design limits are not exceeded as a result of a wide range of AOOs</li>
<li> no single malfunction of the reactivity control function can cause a violation of the acceptable fuel design limits</li>  </ul>  <p>The nuclear design reactivity control requirements and control provisions should:</p>  <ul>
<li> compensate for long-term reactivity changes of the core; this includes reactivity changes due to depletion of the fissile material in the fuel, depletion of burnable poison in some of the fuel rods (where applicable), and buildup of fission products and transuranic isotopes</li>
<li> compensate for the reactivity change caused by changing the temperature of the reactor from the zero power hot condition to the cold shutdown condition</li>
<li> compensate for the reactivity effects caused by changing the reactor power level from full-power to zero power</li>
<li> assure reactivity management during the fuelling cycle, and intermediate times during the fuel cycle</li>
<li> compensate for the effects on the power distribution and stability of the high cross-section neutron capture of the fission product nuclide xenon-135</li>
<li> cover uncertainties associated with the control rods, including:</li>
<ul>
<li> manufacturing tolerances</li>
<li> methods errors</li>
<li> operation other than planned</li>
<li> control element absorber depletion</li>
<li> measurement uncertainty in shutdown margin demonstration</li>
</ul>  </ul>  <h5>Reactivity devices configurations and reactivity worth </h5>  <p>The nuclear design should establish the following for reactivity device configurations, including (where applicable) control rod patterns, and reactivity worth for:</p>  <ul>
<li> reactivity devices configurations expected throughout a fuel reload cycle, power manoeuvring, and load-following (where applicable). This includes operation of single rods, or of groups or banks of rods, rod withdrawal order, and insertion limits, as a function of power and core life</li>
<li> predicted reactivity devices&#8217; worth and reactivity insertion rates. It should be reasonably bounded to values that may occur in the reactor. Note: These values are typically used in the safety analysis, and judgments as to the adequacy of the uncertainty allowances are made in the review of the safety analysis</li>
<li> allowable deviations from the patterns indicated above, such as for misaligned rods, stuck rods, or rod positions used for spatial power shaping</li>
<li> maximum worth of individual rods or banks as a function of position for power and cycle life conditions appropriate to rod withdrawal, rod ejection (or drop) accidents and other conceivable failures of reactivity control components leading to positive reactivity insertions</li>
<li> maximum rates of reactivity increase associated with reactivity device withdrawals and any other conceivable change in the configuration of reactivity devices, due to failures in reactivity control system.

<h3><a name="P1823_185285" id="P1823_185285"></a>8.2 Reactor coolant system</h3>  <p>In order to meet safety requirements of the reactor coolant system (RCS), the design should have adequate provisions with regards to reactor coolant system and reactor auxiliary systems. The design should meet design limits for the worst conditions encountered in normal operation, AOOs and DBAs, including pressurized thermal shock and water hammer loads. The reactor coolant system and reactor auxiliary systems should meet &#8211; or contribute to meeting &#8211; the following:</p>  <ul>

<li> remove heat from the core in appropriate operational states and in accident conditions with the reactor coolant pressure boundary intact</li>
<li> transfer heat from other safety systems to the ultimate heat sink</li>  </ul>  <p>The design of each reactor auxiliary system should ensure that automatic action by the system cannot impair a safety function.</p>  <p>The design authority should demonstrate the adequacy of the following:</p>  <ul>

<li>design of instrumentation taps</li>  </ul>  <p>The following provides a few examples of design expectations of the reactor coolant system and reactor auxiliary system:</p>  <h5>Pressurizer</h5>  <p>For designs that include a pressurizer, the design authority should demonstrate the adequacy of the following:</p>  <ul>

<h3><a name="P1895_191519" id="P1895_191519"></a>8.4 Means of shutdown </h3>  <p>As stated in RD-337 version 2, <em>&#8220;the design shall include two separate, independent, and diverse means of shutting down the reactor&#8221;. </em></p>  <p>For the two means to be independent of each other, they must not share components. If both means act inside the core and complete separation is not possible, adequate separation of ex-core components should be demonstrated<a name="P1897_191900" id="P1897_191900"></a>.</p>  <p>The design uses diverse methods for all aspects of the shutdown means such as:</p>  <ul>
<li> the insertion of solid control rods and injection of a solution of neutron absorbing material are the diverse methods normally used in water-cooled reactors</li>
<li> diverse methods should be considered in the design of sensors, logic and actuation of the shutdown means</li>  </ul>  <p>As stated in RD-337 version 2, &#8220;<em>redundancy shall be provided in the fast acting means of shutdown&#8221;</em> unless the safety analysis demonstrates that, for any AOO or DBA coincident with failure of a single fast acting means of shutdown, the acceptance criteria can be met. </p>  <p>For shutdown means based on injection of a neutron absorbing solution, chemistry-related issues (such as avoiding precipitation) should be addressed.</p>  <p>The design authority should specify the requirements for inspection, test and maintenance, including commissioning tests to verify the speed and depth of shutdown for each shutdown means.</p>  <p>For LWR designs, fuel rod bowing can lead to loads on control rod guide tubes which may impair a rod-based shutdown means. The fuel design should ensure that this does not occur in operational states and DBAs.</p>  <p>As stated in RD-337 version 2<em>, &#8220;at least one means of shutdown shall be independently capable of</em> <em>rendering the reactor subcritical from normal operation, in AOOs and DBAs, and maintaining the reactor subcritical by an adequate margin and with high reliability, for even the most reactive conditions of the core&#8221;.</em> This normally includes a core with maximum allowable excess reactivity (for example, following batch refuelling) and the most reactive conditions for coolant and moderator temperature and density (for example, at cold shutdown conditions for a reactor with a negative temperature coefficient of reactivity).</p>  <p>For CANDU reactors, there is a possibility of an in-core LOCA. This poses a special challenge to reactivity control systems. In particular, hydraulic loads from an in-core LOCA can damage shutoff rod guides, and possibly damage poison injection nozzles. If shutdown action is required for an in-core LOCA, the design specification should identify how many reactivity devices may be damaged by the in-core LOCA. This should be consistent with the assumptions in the safety analysis. The results of the analysis of the damage extent and supporting experiments should be provided.</p>  <p>The performance criteria for the speed and depth of a fast acting shutdown means should be provided by the design authority. A shutdown means is considered to be effective if the safety analysis acceptance criteria are met. The performance criteria for an adequate subcriticality margin of a shutdown means should be provided by the design authority. </p>  <p>For LWRs, in particular pressurized water reactors (PWRs), a large LOCA can lead to significant hydraulic loads on core internals, such as control rod guides in the upper plenum. Core barrel distortion could lead to misalignments. If control rod insertion is credited in the safety analysis for a large LOCA (most PWRs do not credit rod movement), the design should demonstrate that control rod insertion will not be impeded.</p>  <h4><a name="P1918_195040" id="P1918_195040"></a>8.4.1 Reactor trip parameters </h4>  <p>The effectiveness of trip parameters is assessed through safety analysis performed in accordance with CNSC RD-310, <em>Safety</em> <em>Analysis for Nuclear Power Plants</em>. Further guidance is provided in CNSC GD-310, <em>Guidance on Safety</em> <em>Analysis for Nuclear Power Plants</em>.</p>  <p>Trip coverage should be demonstrated across the full range of operating states, for all credited shutdown means and all credited trip parameters. Note that the number of credited shutdown means and the number of credited trip parameters can vary with the event, the reactor design, and whether there is a direct trip available.</p>  <p>Defining derived acceptance criteria appropriate to a particular design is the responsibility of the design authority. CNSC RD-310, <em>Safety Analysis for Nuclear Power Plants,</em> provides the requirements.</p>  <p>Derived acceptance criteria should be defined separately for AOOs and DBAs. The derived acceptance criteria should be set to give an appropriate level of confidence that a fundamental safety function is assured, or that a barrier to fission product release will not fail. The derived acceptance criteria should:</p>  <ul>
<li> be quantifiable and well understood</li>
<li> account for the fact that the safety analysis is stylized, and the plant condition at the time of the accident may be significantly different from the analyzed state</li>
<li> cover uncertainties in analysis, input plant and analysis parameters, as well as code validation</li>  </ul>  <p>Direct trips are the preferred means of actuating a shutdown means, due to their robustness and low dependence on calculational models.</p>  <p>Diverse trip parameters measure different physical variables on the reactor, thus providing additional protection against common mode failure. Where it is impracticable to provide full diversity of trip parameters, different measurement locations, different instrument types and different processing computers should be provided. Manual trip is considered an acceptable trip parameter, if the operator has adequate time to initiate the shutdown action following unambiguous indication of the need to perform the action (in accordance with RD-337 version 2 section 8.10.4).</p>  <p>It is the responsibility of the design authority to identify and justify those trip parameters that can be considered &#8220;direct&#8221;. The design authority should also demonstrate that any trip parameters that are a measure of the event, but not a measure of the challenge to acceptance criteria, cannot be &#8220;masked&#8221; or &#8220;blinded&#8221; by control system action or other means.</p>  <p>Trips that are dependent on a number of measured variables, such as low DNBR (departure from nucleate boiling ratio) trips in PWRs can only be considered direct if all the variables are direct.</p>  <p>RD-337 version 2<em> </em>states that <em>&#8220;for each credited means of shutdown, the design shall specify a direct trip parameter to initiate reactor shutdown for all AOOs and DBAs in time to meet the respective derived acceptance criteria. Where a direct trip parameter does not exist for a given credited means, there shall be two diverse trip parameters specified for that means. </em></p>  <p><em>For all AOOs and DBAs, there shall be at least two diverse trip parameters unless it can be shown that failure to trip will not lead to unacceptable consequences&#8221;.</em></p>  <p>The first paragraph is interpreted to apply to each assigned individual means of shutdown credited in the plant&#8217;s safety case, for all AOOs and DBAs. It requires only one trip parameter, as long as it is &#8220;direct&#8221; in nature. If a direct parameter is not available, then there must be two diverse parameters for that assigned means.</p>  <p>The second paragraph is interpreted to distinguish between reactor designs:</p>  <ul>
<li> reactors with inherent safety &#8211; designs that demonstrate that an AOO or DBA with failure of the fast-acting shutdown means (AOO without reactor trip analysis) will not lead to severe core damage and a significant early challenge to containment </li>
<li> reactors with engineered safety &#8211; designs that cannot demonstrate that an AOO or DBA with failure of the fast-acting shutdown means will not lead to severe core damage and a significant early challenge to containment</li>  </ul>  <p>Table 3 of CNSC GD-310, <em>Guidance on</em> <em>Safety Analysis for Nuclear Power Plants</em>, provides the minimum expectations for the number of trip parameters. </p>  <p>A manual reactor trip can be considered to be equivalent to a trip parameter, if the requirements for crediting operator action from the main control room are met (see subsection 8.10.4) and the reliability of manual shutdown meets the reliability requirements for an automatic trip.</p>  <h4><a name="P1949_199594" id="P1949_199594"></a>8.4.2 Reliability </h4>  <p>As stated in RD-337 version 2, section 7.6<em>, &#8220;the safety systems and their support systems shall be designed to ensure that the probability of a safety system failure on demand from all causes is lower than 10<sup>-3&#8221;</sup></em>. </p>  <p>The reliability calculation should include sensing the need for shutdown, initiation of shutdown, and insertion of negative reactivity. All elements necessary to complete the shutdown function must be included. </p>  <p>The reliability evaluation should be such that the reliability of the shutdown function is such that the cumulative frequency of failure to shutdown on demand can be shown to be less than 10<sup>-5</sup> failures per demand, and the contribution of all&nbsp;sequences involving failure to shutdown&nbsp;to the large release frequency of the safety goals&nbsp;can be shown to be less than 10<sup>-7</sup>/yr.</p>  <p>Section 7.6.2 of RD-337 version 2 requires that the shutdown function is delivered even in the presence of any single failure and even during the worst configuration from testing and maintenance. For example, for a rod based system to meet the SFC, the safety analysis may assume that the two highest worth control rods are unavailable (one for testing, and one assumed to fail on demand, in accordance with the SFC). In this case, no further testing of rods would be allowed until the rod under testing becomes available. </p>  <h4><a name="P1957_200952" id="P1957_200952"></a>8.4.3 Monitoring and operator action</h4>  <p>Sufficient information for this section is found in RD-337 version 2, <em>Design of New Nuclear Power Plants</em>.

<h3><a name="P1960_201129" id="P1960_201129"></a>8.5 Emergency core cooling system </h3>  <p>As stated in RD-337 version 2, &#8220;<em>The design shall take into account the effect on core reactivity of the mixing of ECCS water with reactor coolant water, including possible mixing due to in-leakage</em>.&#8221; For example, PWRs often credit soluble boron in the ECCS accumulators and storage tanks, to supplement control rod insertion for long term reactivity control. The design authority should describe any reactivity control function performed by the ECCS, together with necessary limits and conditions.</p>  <p>ECCS designs should be proven by appropriate experimental programs and computer modelling. It should be demonstrated that there is adequate experimental evidence of ECCS effectiveness. </p>  <p>Examples of items that could be important in the ECCS design include:</p>  <ul>
<li> mechanisms for core bypassing (e.g., downcomer bypass during blowdown in PWRs, or core bypass via steam generators in CANDU)</li>
<li>effects of non-condensable gas on ECCS performance</li>
<li> phenomena that can impede core refill and rewet (such as periods of stagnation, steam binding in PWR steam generators, parallel channel effects in CANDU)</li>
<li> effect of multi-dimensional flow in heat transport system headers in CANDU</li>
<li> effect of non-uniform channel flow resistance in the CANDU core (e.g., peripheral low-flow and low-power channels having much higher flow resistance for ECCS refill)</li>
<li> effect of the pressurizer</li>  </ul>  <p>Section 8.5 of RD-337 version 2 requires that the ECCS is capable of removing residual heat over an extended period. This normally involves recovering water spilled from the break, cooling it and returning it to the reactor. It should be demonstrated that:</p>  <ul>
<li> the design is capable of recirculating coolant even in the presence of the maximum quantity of debris that may be present after a LOCA</li>
<li> possible chemical effects in the reactor building recovery sump have been considered, and any chemical precipitates and other species (such as gels, colloids etc.) cannot significantly impair ECCS recovery flow (for example, at strainers or the heat exchangers)</li>
<li> recovery actions (such as transfer to hot leg injection of ECCS, or transfer to the normal residual heat removal system) are described and shown to be achievable; long-term removal of heat by boiling in the core could potentially lead to deposition or fouling (for example, precipitation of boric acid crystals) impairing flow and heat transfer</li>
<li> wear on bearings and seals has been considered &#8211; including abrasion by small particles and chemical corrosion</li>
<li> natural circulation flows, where credited, are capable of providing sufficient flows and cannot be impaired by such effects as accumulation of non-condensable gas or adverse temperature distributions</li>   </ul>  <p>Sections 7.14 and 7.16 of RD-337 version 2, describe the inspection, test and maintenance requirements which should include:</p>  <ul>
<li> commissioning tests to verify flow, pressure drop and (if applicable) tank isolation after injection for accumulators and other makeup tanks</li>
<li> commissioning tests to verify pump head, flow and system pressure drop for pumped injection</li>  </ul>  <p>As stated in RD-337 version 2, &#8220;<em>in the event of an accident when injection of emergency coolant is required, it shall not be readily possible for an operator to prevent the injection from taking place.</em>&#8221; This can be achieved by a variety of methods to ensure that the blocking action is intentional (such as requiring multiple actions, sequential actions, actions that are spatially separated, or actions that have to be performed by different people).</p>  <p>Emergency operating procedures should prohibit blocking of ECCS injection, unless there is clear and unambiguous indication that it is not needed (for example, if there is clear indication that there is adequate inventory to ensure core cooling, and that the inventory is not decreasing).</p>  <p>Injection of a large volume of cold water may cause pressurized thermal shock to the reactor coolant pressure boundary, or distortion of reactor internals. The design authority should demonstrate that thermal shock has been adequately addressed in the design, in terms of calculating transient fluid conditions at key locations, as well as resulting metal temperature and the corresponding stresses.</p>  <p>Water hammer loads may be generated by operation of valves, or by condensation when cold water is injected into steam filled systems. The design authority should demonstrate that a water hammer assessment has been performed.</p>  <a name="8.6"></a>

<h3><a name="P2087_214262" id="P2087_214262"></a>8.8 Emergency heat removal system </h3>  <p>The emergency heat removal system is to provide a path to ultimate heat sink, in the case that normal heat removal capabilities are not available. The purpose of this system is to prevent accident conditions from escalating and to mitigate their consequences. </p>  <p>Emergency heat removal relates to post-accident heat removal and may be provided by a number of systems, depending on circumstances: </p>  <ul>
<li> post-LOCA heat removal may be provided by ECCS (refer to section 8.5)</li>
<li> for non-LOCA events, emergency heat removal may be through primary or secondary cooling systems</li>  </ul>  <p>For all means of emergency heat removal, the design should be such that all equipment is appropriately designed to function in the class of accidents for which it is credited.</p>  <p>If the system credited has another role in normal operation, then the design should be such that the system will meet the requirements of a safety system when used under accident conditions. The design basis requirements for the system in this role should be provided.</p>  <p>Many of the actions associated with operation of the systems credited for emergency heat removal may not be initiated automatically. When there is reliance on manual operation, the review of human factors considerations should have very high importance.</p>  <p>Primary side emergency heat removal could be through normal shutdown cooling means. The design should be such that </p>  <ul>
<li> a means of depressurizing the primary system is provided and the means of depressurization meets the requirements of a safety system, or </li>
<li> the shutdown cooling system is capable of being operated at full primary pressure and temperature</li>  </ul>  <p>Passive or non-passive (e.g., natural circulation or pumped) heat removal may be used. Non-passive systems require emergency power. Natural circulation systems should demonstrate the capability over the full range of applicable operating conditions.</p>  <p>Secondary side emergency heat removal that relies on water being provided to the secondary side of steam generators may be through a separate pumped supply or through a secondary depressurization and gravity feed.

<li> consideration of all modes of operation, plant states up to DECs and all credible events that could impact the electrical power systems</li>
<li> reliability and availability targets for systems and key equipment</li>
<li> capacity and performance requirements</li>
<li> identification of all loads (i.e., the systems and equipment that require electric power to perform their safety functions) including electrical characteristics, maximum demand conditions, and safety classification </li>
<li> protective schemes and coordination of protection</li>
<li> specification of  acceptable ranges of voltage and frequency for continuous operation of the connected loads for each electrical power system</li>
<li> identification of acceptable ranges for onsite and offsite transient disturbance events that could impact electrical power systems </li>  </ul>  <p>The design should specify the requirements for the preferred power supply (PPS) (i.e. the normal AC power supplies for plant electrical systems important to safety) and the plant interface with the transmission grid to reduce the potential for loss of normal AC power supplies.</p>  <p>Transmission system studies should be undertaken for reasonably expected grid system conditions and disturbances to demonstrate that normal AC power supplies will not be degraded to a level that causes unnecessary challenges to safety systems, standby and emergency power supply systems. Performance criteria should be established for:</p>  <ul>
<li> unit generator performance during defined frequency and voltage excursions to ensure that generators remain connected to the electrical grid</li>
<li> lightning and surge protection design provisions to protect the plant electrical distribution systems against transient over-voltage conditions such as switching and lightening surges</li>  </ul>  <p>The normal AC electrical power systems should have the capacity and capability to supply all plant electrical loads during operational states and accident conditions.</p>  <p>Normal AC power supplies should be designed to:</p>  <ul>
<li> prevent deviations from normal operation</li>
<li> prevent single failures from impacting more than one redundant division of electrical power supply</li>
<li> avoid preventable challenges to standby and emergency systems as a result of an electrical system disturbance, transient, or upset condition (e.g. turbine-generator trip)</li>  </ul>  <p>Electrical power supply from the offsite power system to the onsite power system should be supplied by a minimum of two physically independent transmission lines designed and located in order to minimize, the likelihood of their simultaneous failure. The safety analysis should provide information concerning offsite power circuits coming from the transmission system to the plant switchyard. A switchyard common to both circuits is acceptable but separate transmission line towers should be used. For some reactor designs, it might be justified that only one offsite power connection is sufficient.</p>  <p>Each of the plant&#8217;s offsite transmission lines should have the capacity and capability to supply power to all plant electrical loads under all plant states.</p>  <p>A minimum of one off-site transmission line and associated PPS should be designed to be automatically available to provide power to its associated safety divisions within a few seconds following an AOO or a DBA.</p>  <p>A second PPS circuit should be designed to be available within a period of time commensurate with the requirement to support plant safety functions during AOOs and DBAs.</p>  <p>For plants designed for house load operation, the normal AC power system should be designed to accommodate generator voltage and frequency transients associated with transferring from normal operation to the house load operating mode.</p>  <h5>Additional information</h5>  <p>Further information is available in: </p>  <ul>

This indicates that there will be adequate routes through which, under emergency conditions, the operation staff from one control room can safely leave and reach another control room.</p>  <p>Appropriate measures are taken, including the provision of barriers between the control rooms and the external environment, and adequate information is provided for the protection of occupants of the control room against hazards such as high radiation levels resulting from accident conditions, release of radioactive material, fire, or explosive or toxic gases.</p>  <p>The manual initiation of safety function provides a form of defence in depth for abnormal conditions (including the common-cause failure of the automatic control and protection systems) and supports long-term post-accident operation. Manual actuation should be provided to both system and component levels, where appropriate.</p>  <p>The display and manual controls for critical safety functions initiated by operator action should be diverse from computerized automatic safety systems.</p>  <p>The MCR, secondary control room (SCR) and the emergency support centre (ESC) should have at least two diverse communications links with each other, and also with:</p>  <ul>
<li> areas where communications are needed during AOOs or accident conditions</li>

<li> capable of operating in case of loss of both the onsite and offsite power systems</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>8.10.1.1 Safety parameter display system</strong></p>  <p>The primary function of the safety parameter display system (SPDS) is to serve as an operator aid in the rapid detection of abnormal conditions, by providing a display of plant parameters from which the safety status of operation may be assessed in the control room. The display system may include other functions that aid operating personnel in evaluating plant status. The design of the display system should be flexible to allow for future incorporation of advanced diagnostic concepts and evaluation techniques.</p>  <p>The SPDS should display a minimum set of plant parameters or derived variables from which the safety status of the plant can be assessed. These parameters and variables include:</p>  <ul>
<li> reactivity control</li>
<li> reactor core and irradiated fuel cooling</li>
<li> heat removal from primary system</li>

<li> have sufficient availability and reliability</li>
<li> not display unreliable or invalid data and alarms</li>
<li> be designed to meet the specified human factor usability requirements</li>  </ul>  <p>The display of abnormal operating conditions significant to safety should be distinctly different in appearance from the display depicting normal operating conditions.</p>  <p>The information displayed by the SPDS display should be presented in ways that are easy for the operators to read and understand.</p>  <p>The display should be designed to improve the operator&#8217;s recognition, comprehension, and detection of abnormal operating states.</p>  <h4><a name="P2255_229054" id="P2255_229054"></a>8.10.2 Secondary control room</h4>  <p>Sufficient controls, indications, alarms and displays should be provided in the SCR to bring the plant to a safe state, to provide assurance that a safe state has been reached and maintained, and to provide operators with information on the status of the plant and the trends in key plant parameters. </p>  <p>Suitable provisions outside the MCR should be made for transferring control to the SCR whenever the MCR is abandoned. </p>  <p>Refer to section 8.10.1 for other applicable design guidance and expectations.</p>  <h4><a name="P2261_229580" id="P2261_229580"></a>8.10.3 Emergency support centre</h4>  <p>The design provides an emergency support centre (ESC) to facilitate the following functions:</p>  <ul>
<li> management of overall emergency response</li>
<li> coordination of radiological and environmental monitoring</li>
<li> determination of recommended public protective actions</li>
<li> coordination of emergency response activities with federal, provincial, and municipal agencies</li>  </ul>  <p>Facilities should be provided in the ESC for the acquisition, display, and evaluation of all radiological, meteorological, and plant system data pertinent to determine offsite protective measures.</p>  <p>Facilities used in performing essential ESC functions should be located within the ESC complex. However, supplemental calculations and analytical support of ESC evaluations may be provided from facilities outside the ESC.</p>  <p>The ESC data system should be designed to achieve an appropriate level of reliability.</p>  <p>The location of the ESC should ensure optimum functional and reliability characteristics for carrying out its specific functions.</p>  <h4><a name="P2275_230596" id="P2275_230596"></a>8.10.4 Guidance on equipment requirements for accident conditions</h4>  <p>The design should ensure that no failure of monitoring or display systems will influence the functioning of other safety systems.</p>  <p>As stated in RD-337 version 2, &#8220;<em>if operator action is required for actuation of any safety system or safety support system equipment following indication of the necessity for operator action inside the control rooms, there is at least 30 minutes available before the operator action is required</em>&#8221;. </p>  <p>The time available to perform the actions should be based on the analysis of the plant response to AOOs and accident conditions, using realistic assumptions. The time required for operator action should be based on a human factors engineering (HFE) analysis of operator response time, which (in turn) is based on a documented sequence of operator actions. Uncertainties in the analysis of time required are identified and assessed. An adequate time margin should also be added to the analyzed time. </p>  <p>If operator action is required for actuation of any safety function, other than meeting the requirements of RD-337 version 2, the analysis should also demonstrate that:</p>  <ul>
<li> there is sufficient time available for the operator to perform the required manual action</li>
<li> the operator can perform the actions correctly and reliably in the time available</li>  </ul>  <p>The sequence of actions should use only alarms, controls, and displays that would be available in locations where the tasks will be performed and should be available in all scenarios analysed.</p>  <p>A preliminary validation should be conducted, to provide independent confirmation to the validity of the estimated &#8220;time available&#8221; and &#8220;time required&#8221; for human actions. The preliminary validation results should support the conclusion that the time required, including margin, to perform individual steps and the overall documented sequence of manual operator actions are reasonable, realistic, repeatable, and bounded by the initial analysis.</p>  <p>An integrated system test should also be conducted, to validate the manual actions credited in the safety analysis, using a full-scale simulator. Tasks conducted outside the control room should be included in the integrated system validations.</p>  <h5>Additional information</h5>  <p>Further information is available in:</p>  <ul>

<h3><a name="P2357_241656" id="P2357_241656"></a>9.2 Analysis objectives</h3>  <p>As described in the <em>Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations</em>, a preliminary safety analysis report demonstrating the adequacy of the NPP design is required for an application for a licence to construct a Class I nuclear facility. A final safety analysis report reflecting the &#8220;as-built&#8221; design is required for an application for a licence to operate a Class I nuclear facility.</p>  <a name="9.3"></a>
<h3><a name="P2359_242058" id="P2359_242058"></a>9.3 Hazards analysis</h3>  <p>The objective of the hazards analysis is to determine the adequacy of protection of the nuclear power plant against internal and external hazards, while taking into account the plant design and site characteristics. To ensure the availability of required safety functions and operator actions, all the SSCs important to safety (including the main control room, secondary control room and emergency support centre) should be adequately protected against relevant internal and external hazards. </p>  <p>The hazards analysis should establish a list of relevant internal and external hazards that may affect plant safety. For the relevant hazards, the review should demonstrate, by using deterministic and probabilistic techniques, that the probability or consequences of the hazard are sufficiently low so that no specific protective measures are necessary, or that the preventive and mitigating measures against the hazard are adequate.</p>  <p>All internal and external hazards are considered as part of postulated initiating events (PIEs). The hazards that make an insignificant contribution to plant risk can be screened out from the detailed analysis; however, the rationale for this screening should be provided. The remaining PIEs constitute the scope of the hazard analysis. The design should specify design basis hazards, establishing clear criteria. The design basis hazards should be analyzed using the deterministic safety analysis rules and criteria provided in section 9.4. Such analysis should also demonstrate the adequacy of the complementary design features in mitigating radiological consequences of design extension conditions.</p>  <p>The hazards analysis should demonstrate that the design incorporates sufficient safety margins to mitigate cliff-edge effects.</p>  <h5>Additional information</h5>  <p>Further information is available in:</p>  <ul>

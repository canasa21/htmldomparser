<h2>3.0 RELEVANT REQUIREMENTS</h2>
<p>The provisions of the NSCA and the regulations made under the NSCA relevant to this guide are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li> Section&nbsp;27 of the NSCA states, in part, that &ldquo;Every licensee and every prescribed person shall (<em>a</em>)&nbsp;keep the prescribed records, including a record of the dose of radiation received by or committed to each person who performs duties in connection with any activity that is authorized by this Act or who is present at a place where that activity is carried on, retain those records for the prescribed time&hellip;&rdquo;;</li>
<li> Paragraph&nbsp;3(1)(<em>e</em>) of the <em>General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations</em> states that &ldquo;An application for a licence shall contain the following information:&nbsp;&hellip;&nbsp;(<em>e</em>)&nbsp;the proposed measures to ensure compliance with the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em>&hellip;&rdquo;;</li>
<li> Section&nbsp;28 of the <em>General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations</em> states that:<br />
&ldquo;(1)&nbsp;Every person who is required to keep a record by the Act, the regulations made under the Act or a licence shall retain the record for the period specified in the applicable regulations made under the Act or, if no period is specified in the regulations, for the period ending one year after the expiry of the licence that authorizes the activity in respect of which the records are kept.<br />
&ldquo;(2)&nbsp;No person shall dispose of a record referred to in the Act, the regulations made under the Act or a licence unless the person (<em>a</em>)&nbsp;is no longer required to keep the record by the Act, the regulations made under the Act or the licence; and (<em>b</em>)&nbsp;has notified the Commission of the date of disposal and of the nature of the record at least 90&nbsp;days before the date of disposal.<br />
&ldquo;(3)&nbsp;A person who notifies the Commission in accordance with subsection&nbsp;(2) shall file the record, or a copy of the record, with the Commission at its request&rdquo;;</li>
<li> Paragraph&nbsp;4(<em>a</em>) of the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em> states, in part, that &ldquo;Every licensee shall implement a radiation protection program and shall, as part of that program, (<em>a</em>)&nbsp;keep the amount of exposure to radon progeny and the effective dose and equivalent dose received by and committed to persons as low as is reasonably achievable, social and economic factors being taken into account, through the implementation of&nbsp;&hellip;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;control of occupational and public exposure to radiation&rdquo;;</li>

<li> Section&nbsp;24 of the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em> states that &ldquo;Every licensee shall keep a record of the name and job category of each nuclear energy worker.&rdquo;</li>  </ol>   <a name="4.0"></a>
<h2>4.0 SELECTING PARTICIPANTS</h2>
<p>The objective of a monitoring program is to determine the criteria for participation in the program, the frequency of monitoring, and the actions taken on the basis of measurement results. </p>
<p>Four types of monitoring programs are described in this section: baseline radiobioassay monitoring, routine radiobioassay monitoring, special radiobioassay monitoring, and screening. Sections&nbsp;5.0 and 6.0 describe the frequency of monitoring and interpreting results.</p>   <a name="4.1"></a>
<h3>4.1 Baseline Radiobioassay Monitoring</h3>
<p>Baseline monitoring consists of assessing, at the start of employment or a new job where radiobioassay monitoring will be involved, a worker&rsquo;s body burden of radionuclides of interest. This assessment determines a background for the new employee.</p>
<p>A baseline radiobioassay should be performed on all workers who participate in a routine radiobioassay monitoring program. The type of baseline measurement should be relevant to the radionuclides for which the worker will be routinely monitored. Baseline monitoring is not required for air monitoring&nbsp;[1,&nbsp;2].</p>   <a name="4.2"></a>
<h3>4.2 Routine Radiobioassay Monitoring</h3>
<p>Doses resulting from intakes of radionuclides should be assessed for all workers who are likely to receive a committed effective dose (CED) exceeding 1&nbsp;mSv per year. When workers are not likely to receive annual doses exceeding 1&nbsp;mSv, the cost of performing routine radiobioassay may not always be justified for the doses involved; therefore, other means of assessing exposure, such as screening, should be considered.</p>
<p>The likelihood of exceeding 1&nbsp;mSv per year may be assessed on the basis of the activity handled by the worker, the type of radionuclides involved, the physical and chemical form of the radionuclides, the type of containment used, and the nature of the operations performed. When one type of radionuclide is handled essentially daily (i.e., approximately 250&nbsp;days per year), workers handling the activities in Table&nbsp;1 should participate in a radiobioassay program. Note that, to decide on participation, monitoring data (if available) should supersede the data in Table&nbsp;1.</p>
<p>The basis for the values in Table&nbsp;1 is presented in Appendix&nbsp;A, <em>Selecting Participants in a Routine Program Based on Activity Handled</em>, and can be used to derive site-specific values. Appendix&nbsp;A defines parameters needed to define the Potential Intake Fraction (PIF). Given a particular scenario of intake, the value ALI&nbsp;/&nbsp;PIF represents the activity handled per day of operation that could result in an annual intake equal to the Annual Limit on Intake (ALI), consequently resulting in a committed effective dose of 20&nbsp;mSv per year. The criterion set for the radiobioassay participation is 1&nbsp;mSv. Therefore, the data shown in Table&nbsp;1 represent the quantity ALI&nbsp;/&nbsp;(20&nbsp;*&nbsp;PIF).</p>

</tr>  </table>  <p>Radiobioassay is recommended if the worker is required to wear respiratory protection equipment specifically to limit the intake of radionuclides.</p>
<p>Pseudo-sealed sources&nbsp;[3] apply to short half-life radionuclides (less than 7&nbsp;days) that are handled exclusively in sealed vials and syringes and that meet the following conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li> The radiological half-life is less than 7 days,</li>
<li> The handling of radioactivity is more or less uniform throughout the year,</li>
<li> The radioactive material is not aerosolized, or boiled in an open or vented container,</li>
<li> The radioactive material is in the form of a dilute liquid solution, and</li>
<li> The radioactive material is contained in a multi-dose vial that is never opened and amounts are withdrawn only into hypodermic syringes for immediate injection into another multi-dose vial, or another form of closed containment, or into patients.</li>  </ol>
<p>The data in Table&nbsp;1 are provided as generalizations and may not cover all scenarios. It is also assumed that where there are mechanical or other physical barriers in place to protect the worker (such as gloveboxes and fumehoods), the barriers are appropriate for the radioisotope being handled and that they are used as intended and maintained in a proper manner.</p>
<p>When more than one type of radionuclide<strong> </strong>is handled, the following steps should be followed to determine if a worker should participate in a radiobioassay program:</p>
<ol>
<li> Calculate the ratio, r<em><sub>j</sub></em>, of the quantity of one radionuclide, j, handled in daily operation to the maximum quantity of that radionuclide that can be handled in daily operation above which radiobioassay is recommended, from Table&nbsp;1.</li>
<li> Calculate this ratio for all other radionuclides handled.</li>
<li> Add all of the ratios calculated in steps&nbsp;1 and 2 above: <br />
R = &Sigma; r<em><sub>j</sub></em></li>  </ol>
<p>Radiobioassay should be performed for any radionuclides for which r<em><sub>j</sub></em>&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;1. If R&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;1, radiobioassay should be performed for any radionuclides for which r<em><sub>j</sub></em>&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0.3 [4]. A worked example is provided in Appendix&nbsp;B, <em>Examples</em>, Example&nbsp;1.</p>   <a name="4.3"></a>
<h3>4.3 Special Radiobioassay Monitoring</h3>
<p>Special radiobioassay monitoring is performed to verify an indication of a significant unplanned intake or to assess a worker&rsquo;s dose as a result of a significant unplanned intake. Special radiobioassay monitoring may be triggered by either a routine monitoring result or an abnormal incident suggesting that an action level (as defined in the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em>) or the dose limit may have been exceeded. Guidance on special radiobioassay monitoring can be found in regulatory document G-147, <em>Radiobioassay Protocols for Responding to Abnormal Intakes of Radionuclides</em>&nbsp;[5].</p>   <a name="4.4"></a>
<h3>4.4 Screening</h3>
<p>When workers handle unsealed radionuclides but do not meet the criteria for participation in a routine radiobioassay program, it is recommended that intake monitoring be performed in the form of a screening program. The screening frequency may be the same as for routine monitoring or may be different if handling the unsealed radionuclides infrequently (e.g., within a few days after handling), taking into account the biological half-life of the radionuclides.</p>
<p>In a screening program, workers either submit to an in vivo count or submit an in vitro radiobioassay sample (see section&nbsp;5.1). Results are compared to a trigger level, such as the Derived Activity (DA; described in section&nbsp;6.2), without the need for dose assessment or intake estimation. Exceeding the predetermined trigger level should require a confirmation of intake and an investigation.</p>
<p>When a worker frequently exceeds the trigger level, the worker&rsquo;s need to participate in a routine radiobioassay program should be re-evaluated. All screening results should be recorded.</p>   <a name="5.0"></a>
<h2>5.0 METHOD AND FREQUENCY OF RADIOBIOASSAY</h2>
<p>A range of radiobioassay sampling methods can be used (e.g., urine analysis, whole body counting, thyroid counting), according to the type of radioactive material handled and frequency at which workers are monitored.</p>   <a name="5.1"></a>
<h3>5.1 Methods of Radiobioassay</h3>
<p>Methods of radiobioassay measurement are classified in two categories:</p>
<ol>
<li> In vivo radiobioassay refers to direct measurement of the amount of radioactive material deposited in organs, tissues, or the whole body. Common methods are thyroid counting, lung counting, and whole body counting.</li>
<li> In vitro radiobioassay refers to measuring the amount of radioactive material in a sample taken from the body. The most common method is urine analysis. Other methods are fecal, breath, and blood analysis.</li>  </ol>
<p>Several factors should be considered when selecting the method of radiobioassay monitoring. The first factor is the objective of monitoring&mdash;there should be a balance between the needs for intake monitoring and dose assessment [2]. The intake monitoring requires timely information about the occurrence of intakes and should be based on the following indicators of intake, in order of preference:</p>
<ol>
<li> Personal air sampler (PAS), where air sampling is performed in the worker&rsquo;s breathing zone;</li>
<li> In vitro radiobioassay;</li>
<li> In vivo radiobioassay.</li>  </ol>
<p>The radiobioassay methods that should be used for dose assessment purposes are, in order of preference:</p>
<ol>
<li> In vivo radiobioassay;</li>
<li> In vitro radiobioassay;</li>
<li> Personal air sampling.</li>  </ol>
<p>In addition to these factors, the physical characteristics of the radionuclides of interest should be taken into account. Some radionuclides emit radiation that cannot be detected from outside the body. In this case, a decay product may be measured, such as <sup>234</sup>Th when assessing the <sup>238</sup>U lung burden. Alternately, in vitro radiobioassay may be performed. The preferred method of in vitro measurement also depends on the retention and excretion of the radionuclide of interest, including the predominant route of excretion, e.g., urinary, fecal, breath.</p>
<p>Table 2 illustrates selected methods of radiobioassay measurement that may be performed for various radionuclides, taking into account their physical and metabolic characteristics.</p>
<p>Note: In cases where radiobioassay is inadequate for the determination of doses, air monitoring data may be used for dose estimation. See Section 5.2.</p>

<h3>5.2 Determining Frequency</h3>
<p>When selecting a routine monitoring frequency, the main factors to be taken into account are:</p>
<ol>
<li> The workplace characteristics;</li>
<li> The uncertainty in the time of intake;</li>
<li> Instrument sensitivity;</li>
<li> The need for timely information concerning the occurrence of intakes; and</li>
<li> The cost of implementing the monitoring program.</li>  </ol>
<p>For each radionuclide in the workplace, the physical and chemical form should be known for both routine and accident conditions. These forms determine the biokinetic behaviour of each radionuclide, and therefore their excretion routes and rates. In turn, this behaviour helps to determine the radiobioassay method.</p>
<p>The retention and excretion depends mainly on the chemical form of the radionuclide. Inhaled compounds are classified into three types, based on their rate of absorption from the lung to blood: F (Fast), M (Moderate), and S (Slow). For example, a type F compound such as UF<sub>6</sub> is absorbed into blood relatively quickly from the lungs. Type S compounds, such as UO<sub>2</sub>, remain in the lungs for a longer period of time. Default lung absorption rates are available in <em>Human Respiratory Tract Model for Radiological Protection</em>, International Commission on Radiological Protection, Publication 66, Vol. 24, No. 1-3 [6] for the three lung clearance types and criteria for absorption type classification when site specific data are used to characterize workplace air.</p>
<p>Another factor in selecting a routine monitoring frequency is the uncertainty in the intake estimate, due to the unknown time of intake (see Appendix B, <em>Examples</em>, Figures B3 and B4). For weekly monitoring, there is greater uncertainty in the time of intake in the case of urinary excretion (see Appendix B, Figure B4) due to the larger variation in excretion rate in the first days post-intake. Routine measurement results should be assessed in such a way that the intake is assumed to have taken place at the mid-point in the monitoring period.</p>
<p>Instrument sensitivity has a significant impact on the monitoring frequency. The latter should be selected so as to ensure that significant doses are not missed. A dose could be missed if following an intake, the body content rendered by excretion rate was reduced to a level less than the instrument&rsquo;s Minimum Detectable Amount (MDA) during the time between intake and measurement. When practicable, the monitoring period should be such that annual intakes corresponding to a total committed dose of 1 mSv do not go undetected. If this cannot be achieved, workplace monitoring and personal air sampling should be used to supplement intake monitoring. By applying the appropriate metabolic model and assuming a pattern of intake, a suitable monitoring period can be determined.</p>

<p>Generally, K must be determined by personnel performing radiobioassay measurements. More information on MDAs for radiobioassay can be found in <em>American National Standard&ndash;Performance Criteria for Radiobioassay</em>, Health Physics Society [8].</p>
<p>Using this method for monitoring period determination, a recommended monitoring period of one year could be possible for some radionuclides. However, most individuals&rsquo; retention and excretion rates tend to vary from the model on which the DA values are based. Also, timely information about the occurrence of intakes is needed. There should be a balance between using radiobioassay as an intake indicator and for dose assessment purposes. To account for this, a monitoring period shorter than one year may be selected depending on other types of monitoring in place (such as workplace air monitoring), and the practicability of carrying out the radiobioassay measurements. Monitoring periods have been recommended in radionuclide-specific reports (such as for uranium dose assessment [9]).</p>   <a name="5.3"></a>
<h2>5.3 Other Dosimetric Considerations</h2>
<p>In addition to the recommendation that <sup>1</sup>/<sub>20</sub>&nbsp;ALI intakes be detectable throughout the monitoring period, other dosimetric considerations can be used to help in determining radiobioassay frequency.</p>
<p>ICRP has recommended that the accuracy should be better than a factor of 2&nbsp;[7] at the 95% confidence level for doses received from external sources of exposure, but that for internal exposures this level of accuracy may not always be possible. Uncertainty due to the unknown time of intake is only one component of the overall uncertainty in the dose calculation. The monitoring periods recommended in <em>Individual Monitoring for Internal Exposure of Workers, Replacement of ICRP Publication&nbsp;54</em>, International Commission on Radiological Protection, Publication&nbsp;78&nbsp;[7], accept a factor of 3 uncertainty in intake due to this unknown time of exposure during the monitoring period. If there are several monitoring periods in the year, the overall uncertainty in the annual intake, and committed dose, would likely be less than this factor of 3&nbsp;[10]. Exposure to some internal sources, such as low levels of tritiated water in some CANDU reactor environments, may occur continually throughout the monitoring period.</p>
<p>In some cases, the best available monitoring methods may still be unable to detect reliably activities corresponding to the <sup>1</sup>/<sub>20</sub>&nbsp;ALI (1&nbsp;mSv per year). In these circumstances it is useful to determine the maximum dose that could be missed were an intake to occur at the start of each monitoring period. Such an approach provides a useful perspective for some difficult internal hazards&nbsp;[11] but can become overly conservative, particularly when there are several monitoring periods per year.</p>   <a name="6.0"></a>
<h2>6.0 INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS</h2>   <a name="6.1"></a>
<h3>6.1 Reference Levels</h3>
<p>A reference level is the value of measured quantities above which some specified action or decision should be taken.</p>
<p>Reference levels may be used for interpreting workplace or radiobioassay monitoring data and to signal potential intakes. Applicable to routine and special radiobioassay monitoring programs, these levels allow a graded response to potential intakes and therefore are not intended to be a regulatory limit per se. Reference levels are typically expressed as fractions of the ALI. The sum of ratios (intake over ALI) should be used when more than one radionuclide is involved.</p>
<p>Because radiobioassay monitoring programs rarely measure intake, derived reference levels&ndash;expressed in terms of the quantity that is measured&ndash;are generally a more useful quantity. A derived reference level is the bioassay-determined activity due to occupational sources. The derived reference level for a particular radiobioassay measurement is expressed in the same units as the radiobioassay measurement results. For routine radiobioassay programs, reference levels should be based on an assumption of intake at the mid-point in the monitoring period.</p>
<p>For some radionuclides and types of radiobioassay, non-occupational sources (such as uranium and cesium) may cause typical results to exceed the analytical decision level and a derived reference level. If radiobioassay results normally or often exceed a derived reference level due to non-occupational sources, the derived reference level may be increased if expected radiobioassay results due to non-occupational sources are known (a study using a control group with similar non-occupational exposure but no potential for occupational exposure may be used for this purpose). The adjusted derived reference level is set no higher than the 99 percentile of the control group [2]. If non-occupational levels exceed the Derived Investigation Level (DIL), then alternate methods of intake monitoring should be used if possible.</p>
<p>The reference levels used in this report are the DA, the Investigation Level (IL), and the DIL. The DA is defined in Section 5.2. The IL and DIL are defined below.</p>
<p>IL = (0.3 ALI) (<img src="/eng/acts-and-regulations/consultation/comment/rd-150/images/RD-150_draft2_e-5.gif" alt="RD-150_draft" width="31" height="41" />)</p>

<p>An example of a DIL table for <sup>137</sup>Cs inhalation of type F compounds is given in Appendix B, <em>Examples</em>, Table B2.</p>
<p>To account for the reduced dose limit for pregnant workers, a DIL for pregnant workers should be established. Given that the pregnant worker dose limit is 4 mSv for the remainder of pregnancy, ensuring that the pregnant worker&rsquo;s dose is &lt; 0.5 mSv per month helps to ensure the 4 mSv limit is not exceeded. Consequently, a DIL for pregnant workers, DIL<sub>PW</sub>, may be set as:</p>

<h3>6.2 Putting Radiobioassay Results in Perspective</h3>
<p>Radiobioassay results may be interpreted by comparison with derived reference levels. Table&nbsp;3 provides suggested reference levels that may form the basis for interpreting radiobioassay results and for taking appropriate actions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Table 3: Derived Reference Levels and Recommended Corresponding Actions</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Radiobioassay Result</strong></p>  <p><strong>Recommended Action</strong></p>
<p>&lt;&nbsp;DA</p>  <p>Record the radiobioassay measurement result.</p>
<p>DA&nbsp;&le; result &lt;&nbsp;DIL</p>  <p>Confirm and record the radiobioassay measurement result.</p>
<p>If the result is confirmed, assess the CED.</p>  <p>&ge;&nbsp;DIL</p>
<p>Confirm and record the radiobioassay measurement result.</p>
<p>If the result is confirmed, assess the CED.</p>  <p>Investigate to find and correct the cause of the intake.</p>
<p>To assess the CED, the radiobioassay results should first be combined with <em>m</em>(T/2) to estimate the intake:</p>
<p><img src="/eng/acts-and-regulations/consultation/comment/rd-150/images/RD-150_draft2_e-8.gif"  alt="RD-150-Draft" width="160" height="53" /></p>
<p>The CED can then be estimated by setting:</p>
<p>CED&nbsp;=&nbsp;Intake&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;e(50)</p>
<p>where e(50) is the dose per unit intake for the radionuclide, particle size and chemical form of interest&nbsp;[12].</p>   <a name="6.3"></a>
<h3>6.3 Accuracy of Radiobioassay Results</h3>
<p>Many components contribute to the overall accuracy of a dose estimate. These include the accuracy of:</p>
<ol>
<li> The detector system,</li>
<li> The measurement methodology,</li>
<li> The biological model used to relate the observable internal radioactivity to the radiation dose received, and</li>
<li> The uncertainty of the actual time of internalization of the radioactivity relative to the time of the radiobioassay measurement.</li>  </ol>
<p>This section deals only with the accuracy of components&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;2. All aspects of the biological model uncertainty, which sometimes may be the predominant source of inaccuracy and uncertainty in the final dose estimation, are detailed in <em>Reliability of the ICRP&rsquo;s Systemic Biokinetic Models</em>, Radiation Protection Dosimetry, Vol.&nbsp;79, R.W.&nbsp;Leggett&nbsp;[13]. Uncertainties related to the time of intake with respect to the time at which the monitoring is performed are discussed briefly in section&nbsp;5.2.</p>
<p>In designing and setting up any radiobioassay monitoring program, it is important to consider the accuracy of the instrumentation relative to the measurement that has to be made. The complete measurement system should be such that any error in the final measurement would have a minor influence on the overall accuracy of the estimated radiation dose received by the worker. As some of the other uncertainties (i.e., items&nbsp;3 and 4, above) are significant, it is considered adequate that the detection instrument component of the uncertainty lies within the range -25% to +50%&nbsp;[14].</p>
<p>The following considerations should be included in the evaluation of detection instrument accuracy and measurement methodology:</p>
<ol>
<li> The net statistical counting error.<br />
<br />
This includes the statistical error in the radiobioassay count and the statistical error in the measurement of the background count rate. The background count rate measured should be appropriate for the standard, sample or subject.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li> The error caused by variations in counting geometry.<br />
<br />
This should include allowances for physical variations in the subjects or samples being counted, particularly as related to the specific counting equipment being used.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>The error introduced by the attenuation of the emitted radiation by overlying tissue during in vivo counting.<br />
<br />
The effect of overlying tissue should be considered where the gamma emission of a nuclide in question is less than 200&nbsp;keV&nbsp;[15], or where <em>Bremsstrahlung</em> from beta emissions are being counted. This requires the estimation of the average depth and density of the overlying tissue, which may vary significantly from one individual to another.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li> The instrument calibration with respect to the isotope being measured in a geometry that is relevant to the actual measurement.<br />
<br />
The response of the radiobioassay instrument should be calibrated with respect to the isotope of interest and a regular quality control program should be in place to ensure that this calibration is constantly maintained. Frequent internal checks using a long-lived radioactive source should be performed on a regular basis to confirm that the detector response is constant over time and that the instrument is functioning properly.</li>  </ol>

<h2>7.0 RECORDING RADIOBIOASSAY RESULTS</h2>
<p>A record of radiobioassay results enables dose data to be traced for future dose reconstructions.</p>
<p>To comply with Section&nbsp;27 of the NSCA, Section&nbsp;28 of the <em>General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations</em>, and Subsection&nbsp;5(1) and Section&nbsp;24 of the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em>, a radiobioassay record shall be kept for each individual participating in the radiobioassay program, and this record shall clearly identify the employee by name and job category. Additional information may be required to comply with licence conditions. For each dosimetry period, the radiobioassay data should be kept, as well as the date the measurement was taken. Records should also include instrument quality control, calibration results, and records of traceability to primary or secondary laboratories.</p>

<h3>B.2 Example&nbsp;2: Determining the Counting Error (Uncertainty)</h3>  <p>The steps to calculate the error resulting from the detector system (counting statistics), and a demonstration of how the counting error is calculated from a single radiobioassay result, are shown below:</p>  <p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct measurement results:</p>  <table className="table table-striped">

= 25,077/10 min.<br />
= 2,508 counts per minute (cpm)</p>  <p>Similarly, the background count rate is calculated as follows:</p>  <p>Background count rate = (Background count) / (Background count time)<br />

<h3>B.3 Example&nbsp;3: Determining the Monitoring Frequency for Intakes of <sup>137</sup>Cs</h3>
<p>Table&nbsp;2 in Section&nbsp;5.1 illustrates that both whole body counting and urine analysis (gamma counting) are appropriate for detecting <sup>137</sup>Cs. The monitoring period for whole body counting is considered first.</p>
<p>Derived Activities (DA) for <sup>137</sup>Cs in vivo radiobioassay following an inhalation intake have been plotted against various monitoring periods to obtain the graph in Figure&nbsp;B1. The detection limit has been superimposed onto the plot. This figure illustrates that 1&nbsp;DA may be detected over a wide range of monitoring periods. Any period up to one year could therefore be a reasonable interval between monitoring employees. Other considerations described in Section&nbsp;5.2 may likely influence the final choice of the monitoring period.</p>
<p><strong><em>Figure&nbsp;B1: Acute Inhalation of Type&nbsp;F <sup>137</sup>Cs&ndash;Activity Associated with<br />
1&nbsp;mSv as a Function of Time</em></strong></p>
<p><img src="/eng/acts-and-regulations/consultation/comment/rd-150/images/b1.png" alt="rd-150" width="550" height="338" /></p>
<p>The alternative to whole body counting of <sup>137</sup>Cs is in vitro analysis. Again, the DA is compared to the Minimum Detectable Amount (MDA) for several monitoring frequencies. Figure&nbsp;B2 illustrates that the detection limit of 1&nbsp;Bq/L&nbsp;[7] does not exceed the DA from 7 to 365&nbsp;days. Therefore, other factors, described in Section&nbsp;5.2, are useful in selecting an appropriate monitoring frequency.</p>

Inhalation of Type&nbsp;F <sup>137</sup>Cs</em></strong></p>

<h3>B.4 Example&nbsp;4: Determining the Monitoring Frequency for Intakes of <sup>131</sup>I</h3>
<p>An achievable MDA of 100&nbsp;Bq for thyroid monitoring for <sup>131</sup>I has been suggested&nbsp;[7]. As in the previous example, DA is plotted against various monitoring periods from 2 to 180&nbsp;days. The result is illustrated in Figure&nbsp;B3.</p>
<p>From the graph it is clear that if the monitoring period is less than 4&nbsp;days or greater than 65&nbsp;days, the <sup>131</sup>I activity in the thyroid is inferior to the MDA and thus is not detected. In this case, a period of 14 to 30&nbsp;days would be a reasonable time frame for monitoring.</p>
<p><strong><em>Figure&nbsp;B3: <sup>131</sup>I in the Thyroid (Acute Vapour Inhalation) Derived Activity<br />
as Function of Time</em></strong></p>
<p><img src="/eng/acts-and-regulations/consultation/comment/rd-150/images/b3.png"  alt="rd-150" width="550" height="333" /></p>
<p>Although <sup>131</sup>I can be detected by in vitro measurements, Figure&nbsp;B4 suggests that after 5&nbsp;days the quantity of <sup>131</sup>I being excreted is inferior to the MDA of 1&nbsp;Bq/L&nbsp;[7]. In addition, an individual&#39;s rate of radioiodine excretion depends on many factors including diet, age and the use of medications. The individual variation in excretion rate is likely great and therefore a 5&nbsp;day monitoring period may not always allow the detection of 1&nbsp;DA. In this case, urinalysis is not a recommended routine monitoring method for assessing intakes of <sup>131</sup>I.</p>

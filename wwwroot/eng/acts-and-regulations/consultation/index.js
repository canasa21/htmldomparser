<p>Consultation with the public, licensees and interested organizations is an important part of the process the CNSC uses to develop many of the regulatory tools within its <a href="/eng/acts-and-regulations/regulatory-framework/index">regulatory framework</a>. The CNSC welcomes public input on discussion papers and draft documents, and on proposed new regulations or amendments to regulations.</p>
<p>Each document is made available for public comment for a specified period of time. Please note that comments submitted, including names and affiliations, will be made public and will be posted in the official language in which they were received. At the end of the consultation period, CNSC staff review all public input. A consultation report is then prepared, summarizing the feedback.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="http://www.letstalknuclearsafety.ca/">Let&rsquo;s Talk Nuclear Safety</a> to view and comment on proposed changes to regulations, proposed new regulatory documents or changes to regulatory documents, and new discussion papers.</p>
<p>You can also search for consultations on the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/consultations/consultingcanadians.html">Consulting with Canadians</a> website.</p>
<h2>Comment on draft terms of reference</h2>
<p>Currently, there are no terms of reference open for consultation.</p>
<h2 id="R1">Comment on draft regulatory documents</h2>
<p>Currently, there are no regulatory documents open for consultation.</p>
<h2 id="R2">Comment on discussion papers</h2>
<p>Discussion papers play an important role in the  selection and development of the CNSC&#39;s requirements or guidance. They are used  to solicit early public feedback on CNSC policies or approaches. The use of  discussion papers early in the regulatory process underlines the CNSC&#39;s  commitment to a transparent consultation process. The CNSC analyzes and  considers this early feedback when determining the type and nature of  requirements and guidance to issue. This process is intended to streamline  document development and publishing.</p>

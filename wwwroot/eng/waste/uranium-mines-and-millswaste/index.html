When dried, tailings have the consistency of fine sand. </p>    <p>Waste rock is simply rock material removed from the mine to gain access to the ore. It has very little to no concentration of uranium.</p>    <p>Waste rock is separated into clean rock or mineralized rock, according to its mineral content.</p>    <p>Tailings and mineralized waste rock must be managed over the long term because they could contain significant concentrations of radioactive elements (primarily  thorium-230 and radium-226, along with their associated decay products).</p>    <p>Tailings and mineralized waste rock  are contained in engineered surface and near-surface waste management facilities located near the mines and mills.</p>    <ul>      <li><a href="#Tailings">Tailings management</a></li>      <li><a href="#Waste">Waste rock management</a></li>      <li><a href="#Closed">Closed and decommissioned  mines and mills</a>      <ul>        <li><a href="#Ontario">Ontario</a></li>        <li><a href="#Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a></li>        <li><a href="#Northwest">Northwest Territories</a></li>        <li><a href="#Exempted">Exempted Sites</a></li>      </ul></li>    </ul>    <h2 id="Tailings">Tailings management</h2>    <p>Tailings are stored in tailings management facilities (TMFs) designed to isolate the tailings from the surrounding environment for a very long time.</p>    <p>TMFs are located within mined-out open pits or in surface  impoundments, which use geographical features and man-made barriers such as dams to contain the tailings. They are designed to ensure that groundwater and surface water is diverted from the tailings to prevent any contamination. </p>      <p>Tailings are generally deposited  underwater to: </p>    <ul>      <li>prevent  them from oxidizing</li>      <li>provide  shielding from radiation emanating from the tailings </li>      <li>stop  dust from blowing off the surface of the tailings</li>    </ul>  	  <div class="module-poster col-md-3 pull-right"> <img src="/images/waste/uranium-mines-and-millswaste/Tailings_e.jpg" alt="Tailings" /></div>    <p>Tailings are deposited in the TMF as a slurry. The solids settle in the TMF, while the liquids are later collected and processed through a water treatment plant to remove contaminants.</p>    <p>The resulting effluent must meet  regulated quality requirements before it is allowed to be discharged into the environment.</p>    <p>In Canada, tailings are currently deposited in TMFs at Cameco Corporation's Key Lake and Rabbit Lake operations, as well as Orano Canada's McClean Lake operation. </p>    <p>All of these facilities are in-pit TMFs as depicted in the image to the right. </p>    <p>There are also two inactive above-ground TMFs located at the Rabbit Lake  and Key Lake Operations.</p>    <p>The ore extracted from the McArthur River and Cigar Lake Mines is milled and the  tailings are stored at the Key Lake and McClean Lake operations.</p>    <h2 id="Waste">Waste rock management</h2>    <p>In addition to tailings, mining  activities produce large quantities of clean and mineralized waste rock, which  must be excavated to access the uranium ore body. </p>    <p>During mining operations, clean and mineralized  waste rock will be placed in separate rock piles, as each require different  management practices. </p>    <div class="module-poster col-md-3 pull-right"> <img src="/images/waste/uranium-mines-and-millswaste/CAMECO.jpg" alt="" />      <div class="image-caption">        <p>Cameco's Rabbit Lake operation in northern Saskatchewan</p>      </div>    </div>    <p>Clean waste rock can be used for construction activities, such as aggregate in concrete and the construction of roads. </p>    <p>Clean rock that is left over once mining has ceased can be  left in piles on the surface, contoured to blend in with the natural  environment and revegetated.</p>    <p>Mineralized waste rock contains either low-grade ore with little value or  significant concentrations of secondary minerals. </p>    <p>If left exposed on the surface indefinitely, this waste rock could generate acid or release contaminants at rates that could impact the local environment. </p>    <p>During operations, mineralized waste  rock is deposited on impermeable pads. </p>    <p>Seepage and run-off from the mineralized waste rock piles are collected and processed through a water treatment plant to remove contaminants before they are released to the  environment. </p>    <p>Wherever possible, mines are specifically designed to minimize the volume of mineralized rock removed from the mine and to return mineralized waste rock to the mine (as backfill). </p>    <p>Long-term management of mineralized waste rock includes depositing the rock in mined-out open pits, topping them with clean waste rock (or till) and covering surface piles with canopies engineered to minimize the infiltration of water and erosion.</p>    <h2 id="Closed">Closed and decommissioned mines and mills</h2>    <p>There are 20 TMFs located at closed  or decommissioned uranium mines in Canada:  14 in Ontario, four in Saskatchewan and two in the Northwest Territories. </p>    <ul>      <li><a href="#Ontario">Ontario</a></li>      <li><a href="#Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a></li>      <li><a href="#Northwest">Northwest Territories</a></li>    </ul>    <p>These inactive sites are being  managed for the long term by their former owners or by the federal or respective  provincial governments.

A comprehensive study report was completed and  accepted by the CNSC in 2004, resulting in the authorization to proceed with  decommissioning activities.</p>    <p>The active decommissioning of the  mill, tailings management area (TMA) and mining areas was completed between 2004 and 2006. Some  infrastructure was left in place, allowing site monitoring to continue while allowing  Orano Canada  to maintain a full-time presence.</p>    <p>In 2013, Orano Canada requested to  discontinue full-time site presence. The CNSC accepted the request, and the decommissioning  of the remaining infrastructure was completed. The site will continue to be  monitored four times per year.</p>  	<p>In 2019, CNSC held a one-part public hearing to consider an application from Orano Canada Inc. to renew the Uranium Mine Decommissioning Licence for the Cluff Lake Project located in the Athabasca Basin of northern Saskatchewan. Following the hearing, CNSC announced its decision to renew the Uranium Mine Licence allowing Orano to decommission the Project site, possess, manage and store nuclear substances. The licence will be valid from August 1, 2019 to July 31, 2024.</p>    <h4>Beaverlodge</h4>    <p>Cameco Corporation currently holds a waste  facility operating licence for the site.</p>    <p>Uranium mining and milling operations  commenced in 1952 and ceased in 1982.</p>    <p>Decommissioning began in 1982, with  the active decommissioning completed in 1985. Since then, the site has been in  a monitoring and maintenance phase.</p>    <h4>Gunnar and Lorado</h4>    <p>The Saskatchewan Research Council  holds the decommissioning licence for the Gunnar and Lorado sites. Both sites  have yet to be fully decommissioned.</p>    <p>Private-sector companies that no  longer exist operated these facilities from the 1950s until the early 1960s. The  governments of Canada and Saskatchewan are  responsible for the cost of the cleanup. </p>    <p>CNSC staff, together with the  Saskatchewan Ministry of the Environment, regularly inspect these  facilities.  </p>    <h5>Latest CNSC announcements</h5>    <ul>      <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/nuclear-safety-commission/news/2019/12/cnsc-amends-cameco-corporations-beaverlodge-waste-facility-operating-licenc.html">CNSC amends Cameco Corporation&rsquo;s  Beaverlodge Waste Facility Operating Licence </a></li>      <li><a href="http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=1022169">CNSC removes the Gunnar Remediation Project phase 2 hold point as it pertains to the remediation of the tailings deposits</a></li>    </ul>    <h5>Videos</h5>    <ul>      <li><a href="http://www.src.sk.ca/about/featured-projects/pages/gunnar-uranium-mine-and-mill-site.aspx">Gunnar mine site remediation project in Northern Saskatchewan</a> (SRC)</li>      <li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-u9xNAQaXY">Cleaning up mines in Northern Saskatchewan</a> (SRC) </li>    </ul>    <div class="module-poster col-md-3 pull-right"><img src="/images/waste/uranium-mines-and-millswaste/Port_Radium.jpg" alt="" />      <div class="image-caption">        <p>Aerial view of the decommissioned Port Radium mine site</p>      </div>    </div>    <h3 id="Northwest">Northwest Territories</h3>    <p>There are two licensed closed uranium  mine and tailings sites in the Northwest Territories: Port Radium mine and Rayrock mine.</p>    <h4>Port Radium</h4>    <p>The Port Radium site is located in  the Northwest Territories at Echo Bay, on  the eastern shores of Great Bear Lake, about 265 kilometres east of the Dene community of D&eacute;line at the edge of the Arctic Circle. </p>    <p>Mining at the Port Radium site  occurred from 1932 to 1940, from 1942 to 1960 and from 1964 to 1982 &ndash; in the  last instance, to recover silver. </p>    <p>The site was partially decommissioned  in 1984, according to the standards of the day.

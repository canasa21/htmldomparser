<title>Proposed nuclear facility â€“ Global First Power Micro Modular
Reactor Project</title>

<p>Global First Power (GFP) is seeking CNSC approval for a licence
to prepare the site for a micro modular reactor (MMR) at the Chalk
River Laboratories (CRL) site in Renfrew County, Ontario,
approximately 200 kilometres northwest of Ottawa.</p>
<p>The proposed project includes a nuclear plant that contains a
high-temperature gas-cooled reactor to provide approximately 15
megawatts (thermal) of process heat to an adjacent plant via molten
salt, which will generate electrical power and/or heat over an
operating lifespan of 20 years.</p>
<p>A CNSC licence is required under subsection 24(2) of
the&nbsp;<a href=
"http://lois-laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-28.3/"><em>Nuclear
Safety and Control Act</em></a>&nbsp;(NSCA) in order for the
project to proceed. However, an environmental assessment (EA) is
required under the&nbsp;<a href=
"http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-15.21/index.html"><em>Canadian
Environmental Assessment Act, 2012</em></a>&nbsp;(CEAA 2012) before
the Commission can make an NSCA licensing decision.</p>

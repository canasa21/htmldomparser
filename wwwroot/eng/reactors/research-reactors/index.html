<p>Canada has a number of research reactors across the country.
These reactors, much smaller than the ones used in nuclear power
plants, are used to various ends, including scientific research,
non-destructive testing and the production of radioactive
substances for medical, industrial and scientific uses.</p>
<p>Nuclear research reactors are classified as Class I nuclear
facilities. The licensees operating these facilities include
universities, private corporations, and government agencies. The
Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) regulates all stages of
the life of each research reactors in Canada, from the
environmental assessment required before construction, to the
decommissioning of the facility once operations are ended.</p>

<p>At each stage, the CNSC determines whether the licence applicant
is qualified and has taken the required measures to protect the
environment, safeguard human health and safety, and ensure that
national security is maintained.</p>

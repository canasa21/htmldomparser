<h2 id="other1">Shut-down reactors</h2>
<p>Canada has a variety of research and prototype power reactors
that are no longer in use and have been shut down. These reactors
are in a safe storage state and awaiting final decommissioning.</p>
<ul>
<li>The WR-1 organically cooled research reactor located at
Whiteshell Laboratories near Pinawa, MB, operated from 1965 until
1985. It was developed to explore the properties of a
higher-temperature version of the CANDU design, and was used for
nuclear fuel research and other research programs. The reactor is
currently in safe storage, awaiting final decommissioning. <a href=

activities</a>.</li>
<li>The NRX reactor at Chalk River Laboratories (CRL), Canada's
first large-scale research reactor, began operation in 1947 and
played a major role in developing the CANDU reactor. The reactor
was used for the testing of fuels and materials, as well as for
nuclear physics research in support of the Canadian nuclear power
program. After approximately 250,000 hours of operating time, the
NRX reactor was shut down on January 29, 1992. The reactor is
currently in safe storage, awaiting final decommissioning.</li>
<li>The MAPLE-1 and MAPLE-2 (Multipurpose Applied Physics Lattice
Experiment) reactors at CRL were partially activated in 2000 for
the purposes of medical isotope production. However, the reactors
were never fully commissioned, and their development was halted in
2008. Both reactors are in safe storage, awaiting final
decommissioning.</li>
<li>The <a href=
"/eng/reactors/research-reactors/other-reactor-facilities/gentilly-1-facility.cfm">
Gentilly-1 nuclear generating station</a> in Bécancour, QC,
operated intermittently from 1972 to 1978. A decommissioning
program was initiated in 1984 to bring the facility to a safe,
sustainable shutdown state. The site is now partially
decommissioned and is licensed as a waste facility.</li>
<li>The Nuclear Power Demonstration (NPD) reactor in Rolphton, ON,
was Canada’s first nuclear generating station and operated from
1962 until 1987. The site is now partially decommissioned and is
licensed as a waste facility. <a href=

<li>The Douglas Point nuclear generating station in Kincardine, ON,
was Canada’s first commercial-scale nuclear generating station and
a prototype for today’s larger nuclear power plants. It operated
from 1968 to 1986. The site is now partially decommissioned and is
licensed as a waste facility. <a href=

</ul>
<h2 id="other2">Decommissioned reactors</h2>
<p>Fully decommissioned reactors in Canada include the ZEEP and PTR
reactors at CRL (Chalk, River, ON), SLOWPOKE reactors at Dalhousie
University (Halifax, NS), University of Toronto (Toronto, ON),
University of Alberta (Edmonton, AB), Tunney's Pasture (Ottawa, ON)
and MDS Nordion (Kanata,ON).</p>

<p>Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) established the
Whiteshell Laboratories complex for nuclear research during the
early 1960s. A major focus of the program at Whiteshell was the
WR-1 organically cooled research reactor, which was shut down in
1985. The reactor is partially decommissioned and in safe storage
awaiting final decommissioning. The facilities are currently being
decommissioned by Canadian Nuclear Laboratories Ltd.</p>

<p>The CNSC also collaborates with international partners,
including the International Atomic Energy Agency and its foreign
counterparts. Every three years, the CNSC publishes a comprehensive
report as part of the <a href=
"/eng/reactors/power-plants/convention-on-nuclear-safety/index.cfm">
Convention on Nuclear Safety</a>, following up on its commitment to
maintain a high level of safety at all nuclear power plants.</p>
<h3>Did you know?</h3>
<p>The CNSC requires licensees of major nuclear facilities to
develop and implement public information programs to keep the
public in their community informed about their nuclear activities
and any potential related impact on public health and the
environment</p>

<p><a href=

reactor facility projects</a> are being considered in some parts of
Canada.</p>
<p>When the CNSC receives an application for a new plant, its
experts work in multidisciplinary teams to undertake an
environmental assessment and a technical assessment, using the same
14 safety and control areas that form the basis of any future
licensing and regulatory oversight.</p>

<h2 id="DA">Decommissioning activities</h2>
<p>The CNSC regulates the entire lifecycle of nuclear power plants.
<a href=
"/eng/resources/fact-sheets/decommissioning-of-nuclear-power-plants.cfm">
Decommissioning</a> activities are the actions a licensee
undertakes at the end of the useful life of the reactor. The
decision to stop operating and to decommission the reactor is taken
solely by the licensee.</p>
<p>The CNSC's role is to ensure that decommissioning activities are
carried out in accordance with CNSC regulatory requirements to
ensure protection of the workers, the public and the environment,
and to implement Canada's international commitments on the peaceful
use of nuclear energy.</p>
<p>Plans related to the decommissioning of nuclear power plants
take, on average, 50 years to completely implement. As a
requirement for obtaining a licence to operate a nuclear power
plant, the operator must submit a decommissioning plan that
outlines how the operator plans to manage the dismantling of the
plant.</p>
<p>The financial guarantee, which is based on this plan, is also
used by the CNSC to evaluate how the operator will guarantee
financing for decommissioning activities.</p>
<div class="col-md-3 pull-right"><img src=

Gentilly-1 and Gentilly-2, Bécancour, Québec.</div>
<p>Under a normal operating licence, the operator can place the
nuclear facility in safe storage, if it so wishes, as an initial
step to decommissioning.</p>
<p>The Gentilly-2 Nuclear Power Plant in Bécancour, Québec,
recently shut down and will soon take this step. Units 2 and 3 of
the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station, Pickering, Ontario, are
already in safe storage.</p>
<p>Three prototype nuclear reactors constructed and owned by Atomic
Energy of Canada Limited were shut down and prepared for
decommissioning in the 1980s in Rolphton and Kincardine, Ontario
and in Bécancour <span class="nowrap">(Gentilly-1).</span></p>
<p>Today, the CNSC continues to license these facilities as
<a href="/eng/waste/index.cfm#Facilities">waste management
facilities</a>, which continue to safely store radioactive waste
onsite. Funding to proceed with the decommissioning activities is
provided by Canada's <a href=
"http://www.nuclearlegacyprogram.ca/en/sites_en.html">Nuclear
Legacy Liabilities Program</a>.</p>
<p>In the future, all radioactive waste will be removed from those
locations, and decommissioning will eliminate any unreasonable
risks to health, safety, security and the environment. At that
point, those facilities will be issued abandonment licences to
release them from CNSC regulatory control.</p>

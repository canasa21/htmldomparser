<p>The life of a nuclear power plant can be extended for several
decades through refurbishment, by modernizing and enhancing major
equipment and systems to support long-term operation.</p>
<p>In addition to component maintenance, replacement and/or
modifications, refurbishing a facility also provides opportunities
to enhance safety, by modernizing and updating technology and
knowledge.</p>
<p>The CNSC oversees refurbishment projects from the initial
planning before shutdown to the return-to-service.</p>

<h2>Safety note</h2>
<p>If an important safety-related improvement is identified, we do
not wait for a refurbishment to take place!</p>
</div>
<p>Many improvements and upgrades are completed during regularly
scheduled maintenance outages, throughout the normal operating life
of the reactor.</p>
<h2 id="sec1">Preparing a refurbishment</h2>
<p>As part of its licensing process, the CNSC requires a technical
assessment to be completed before authorizing a refurbishment
project.</p>
<p>Two important components of the technical assessment are the
environmental assessment (EA) and the integrated safety review
(ISR).</p>
<h3>Environmental assessment</h3>
<p>An environmental assessment (EA) is completed as part of the
licensing process for the refurbishment of a nuclear power
plant.</p>
<div class="module-poster span-3 pull-right">
<figure><img src="./images/Bruce-A-aerial.jpg" alt="" />
<figcaption>Units 1 and 2 at the Bruce A Nuclear Generating Station
were returned to service in 2013 and 2012 respectively, following
their refurbishment.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The EA addresses the impacts of the refurbishment work and of
extending the facility’s operation for several decades on the
environment, including human health.</p>
<p>For the CNSC to allow refurbishment to proceed, the project
proponent must demonstrate that adequate provisions for the
protection of the environment and the health and safety of people
will be made.</p>
<p>Comprehensive in nature, the EA also looks at the expansion of
the facility (to accommodate waste from refurbishment and continued
operations).</p>
<p>A large number of studies are completed as part of an EA – each
looking at a different aspect, such as the impact on water,
animals, plants, air quality and people.</p>
<p>Public participation opportunities are provided through the
licensing process, which may involve EA-specific consultation
activities and information sessions.</p>
<p>The CNSC offers funding to help stakeholders and Aboriginal
groups participate in those opportunities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Find out more about the CNSC's <a href=
"/eng/the-commission/participant-funding-program/index.cfm">Participant
Funding Program</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Public hearings are conducted at the end of the licensing
process, to publicly examine the findings.</p>
<p>The hearings allow the Commission to hear from everyone
involved, including the project proponent, CNSC staff, technical
experts and the public.</p>
<h3>Integrated safety review</h3>
<p>Completed in parallel with the EA, the integrated safety review
(ISR) identifies all practicable safety improvements that could be
made during the refurbishment.</p>
<div class="module-poster span-3 pull-right">

Station, which was returned to service in November 2012, following
refurbishment.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The ISR provides for a rigorous review of the reactor’s systems,
structures and components against modern standards, experience,
best practices and research findings.</p>
<p>The ISR considers a wide range of safety-related topics
(including plant design, environmental qualification, and
probabilistic safety analysis).</p>
<p>Building on international best practices, the ISR identifies
additional backup systems which enhance the facility’s ability to
prevent accidents and mitigate their consequences, should they
occur. The ISR enables determination of reasonable and practical
modifications that should be made to enhance the safety of the
facility to a level approaching that of modern plants, and to allow
for long-term operation.</p>
<p>This measure is also part of the CNSC’s post-Fukushima action
plan to deal with very low probability events.</p>
<p>As with the EA, the ISR is subject to public scrutiny and open
hearings are held to examine findings.</p>
<h3>Licensing decision</h3>
<p>The CNSC will only approve the project if it is satisfied that
the project proponent identified all practicable safety
improvements to bring the facility up to modern standards.</p>
<p>The licence that covers the facility’s refurbishment identifies
the conditions that must be met before the operator is allowed to
refuel and power up the reactor, to return to service.</p>

<h2 id="sec2">Project execution</h2>
<p>During project execution, the CNSC verifies that the work is
done according to plan, and that safety improvements are designed
to codes, installed and commissioned.</p>
<p>As is the case during regular operation, a team of onsite CNSC
inspectors is present throughout the project, to verify safety and
compliance with the licence.</p>
<p>CNSC staff also include technical specialists in various
disciplines, who review project execution on a regular basis, to
make sure regulatory requirements and licence conditions continue
to be met.</p>
<p>The CNSC reports publicly on the results of its inspections.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info col-md-12">
<h3>Safety note</h3>
<p>During refurbishment, the reactor is defueled, drained of
coolant and some of the normally inaccessible systems are opened to
allow parts to be inspected and replaced, if necessary.</p>
</div>
<h3>Waste minimization</h3>
<p>The principles of "reduce, reuse, recycle" are followed
throughout refurbishment to minimize the amount of disposable
waste.</p>
<p>During the initial planning, the licensee identifies what parts
can be reconditioned and reused safely for another 25 to 30
years.</p>
<p>After reconditioning, these parts are thoroughly tested and
inspected before being reused in the reactor.</p>
<p>Most of the waste produced during refurbishment is
non-radioactive, and can be recycled.</p>
<p>Reduction is another aspect of radioactive waste management.</p>
<p>The radioactive waste is divided carefully by type and nature,
to minimize quantities.</p>
<p>For instance, bulky, low-activity waste such as clothing and
wipes can be incinerated in specially designed facilities to reduce
volume, and metal pieces can be cut and compressed for storage in
special containers.</p>
<h2 id="sec4">Return-to-service</h2>
<p>Once all the refurbishment activities are finished and the
inspections are completed, the CNSC closely monitors the facility’s
refueling and return to service.</p>
<p>The restart is done very gradually, over several months, to
allow for the safety testing of all systems.</p>
<p>The process of returning to service includes progressing to
regulatory <strong>hold points</strong>. The licensee requires CNSC
approval to move on after each stage (hold point) is completed.
Some of the main steps requiring CNSC approval to restart a nuclear
reactor include reloading fuel, approach to criticality and
increase of power above 50%.</p>
<p>Each step ensures verification that all required testing had
been properly done, to ensure that systems function as planned in
safe condition.</p>
<h2 id="sec5">Regulatory experience</h2>
<p>The CNSC has an extensive experience regulating refurbishment
projects.</p>
<p>To date, five reactors have been refurbished in Canada:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pickering Unit 1</li>
<li>Pickering Unit 4</li>
<li>Bruce A Unit 1</li>
<li>Bruce A Unit 2</li>
<li>Point Lepreau</li>
</ul>
<p>All the lessons learned from these projects are integrated into
future refurbishment projects.</p>
<h3>International</h3>
<p>The CNSC is committed to continuous improvement, and exchanges
information with other national nuclear regulators and
international organizations (such as the International Atomic
Energy Agency, a body of the United Nations).</p>
<p>The CNSC works closely with other CANDU regulators.</p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>Nuclear power plant operators fund several research initiatives
in support of refurbishment and life extension projects.</p>
<p>For instance, issues such as obsolescence or aging of structures
and components are being examined by the industry, along with
state-of-the-art studies to assess risk from both internal (e.g.,
fire) and external events (e.g., high winds or earthquakes).</p>
<p>The findings and results of these projects form part of
assessing safe long-term operation by CNSC experts.</p>
<p>Integrating the best available science with its decision making,
the CNSC independently funds its own research initiatives and
programs.</p>
<p>Research is carried out on a wide range of topics, from <a href=
"/eng/resources/health/index.cfm">health studies</a> on nuclear
workers and host communities, to detailed technical studies on
reactor component aging and reliability.</p>
<p>This research is often completed with the support of independent
third-parties, and/or in collaboration with national and
international partners, providing access to valuable expertise,
modern facilities and the best available data.</p>
<p>The CNSC values the use of independent peer reviews, and
encourages technical staff to submit articles for publication in
scientific journals.</p>

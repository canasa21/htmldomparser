<p>Each nuclear power plant in Canada has multiple, robust safety
systems designed to prevent accidents, and reduce its effects
should one occur. All of these systems are maintained and inspected
regularly, and upgraded when necessary, to ensure plants meet or
exceed strict safety standards established by the Canadian Nuclear
Safety Commission. The systems perform three fundamental safety
functions: controlling the reactor, cooling the fuel and containing
radiation.</p>

<h2><a id="R1"></a>How a nuclear power plant works</h2>
<h3>The reactor</h3>
<p>All nuclear power plants in Canada use the CANDU design - a
safe, reliable, reactor technology.</p>
<p>CANDU reactors produce electricity through a process known as
fission. Fission is the process of splitting atoms of natural
uranium inside the reactor, releasing radiation and heat.</p>
<p>The split atoms then continue a “chain reaction”: more atoms
continue to be split, resulting in more radiation and heat.</p>
<p>The heat - energy - is harnessed to make steam to power the
turbines and generators, which in turn produce electricity.</p>
<div style="height:auto;width:595px;color:#666;">
<figure class="module-poster"><img src=
"./images/nuclear-power-plant-safety-systems-2.png" alt=
"This image shows the heat from the fission reaction is used to produce electricity. "
height="142" width="595" /></figure>
</div>
<h3>Used nuclear fuel pool</h3>
<p>After the uranium, or nuclear fuel, has been used in the
reactor, it is removed and stored securely in a pool for a period
of 6 to 10 years.</p>
<p>The water in the pool continues to cool the fuel and provides
shielding against radiation.</p>
<p>All of Canada's fuel pools are built in ground, in separate
buildings at the nuclear power plant, and are designed to withstand
earthquakes<em>.</em></p>
<div style="height:auto;width:500px;color:#666;">

Generating Station, Kincardine, Ontario</figcaption>

<p class="text-right"><a href="#wb-main">Top of page</a></p>
<h2><a name="R2" id="#R2"></a>Controlling the reactor</h2>
<h3>Normal operation</h3>
<p>Controlling the reactor involves increasing, decreasing or
stopping the chain reaction happening inside the reactor.</p>
<p>When the reactor is operating, the chain reaction (or power
level) is controlled by moving adjuster rods and varying the water
level in vertical cylinders.</p>
<p>Sensitive detectors constantly monitor different aspects, like
temperature, pressure and the reactor power level.</p>
<p>When necessary, CANDU reactors can safely and automatically shut
down within seconds.</p>
<h3>Shutdown systems</h3>
<p>All nuclear power reactors in Canada have two independent,
fast-acting and equally effective shutdown systems.</p>
<p>The first shutdown system is made up of rods that drop
automatically and stop the chain reaction if something irregular is
detected.</p>
<p>The second system injects a liquid, or poison, inside the
reactor to immediately stop the chain reaction.</p>
<p>Both systems work without power or operator intervention.
However, they can also be manually activated.</p>
<p>These systems are regularly and safely tested.</p>

</div>
<br />
<h3>Restarting the reactor</h3>
<p>Once a CANDU reactor is shut down, it will stay that way until
restarted by the operators in the control room.</p>
<p>There is no possibility of the reactor accidentally restarting
on its own after it's shut down. The reactor must be manually
restarted. This is another important safety feature.</p>
<p class="text-right"><a href="#wb-main">Top of page</a></p>
<h2><a id="R3"></a>Cooling the fuel</h2>
<h3>Decay heat</h3>
<p>Following shutdown, the amount of energy produced by the reactor
decreases rapidly.</p>
<p>The nuclear fuel will, however, continue to produce some heat
and must be cooled.</p>
<p>That heat, called decay heat, represents a small fraction of the
heat produced during normal operation.</p>

</div>
<h3>Main cooling systems</h3>
<p>Fuel cooling involves three main systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>the heat transport system</li>
<li>the steam system</li>
<li>the condenser cooling system</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>heat transport system</strong> brings the heat
produced by the reactor to the steam generators.</p>
<p>This system is made up of very robust pipes, filled with heavy
water - a rare type of water found in nature. Pipes and other
components are maintained and inspected regularly, and replaced if
necessary.</p>
<p>Inspections include measuring pipe wear and tear and identifying
any microscopic cracks or changes well before they become a
problem.</p>
<h4>Quick fact</h4>
<p>On average, one out of 7,000 drops of water is heavy water. It
is 10% heavier than regular water because it includes a heavy form
of hydrogen called deuterium.</p>

height="288" width="595" />
<figcaption class="image-caption">Heat transport
system</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The second system, the <strong>steam system</strong>, uses
normal water. The heat from the reactor turns this water into steam
to run the turbines and generators.</p>
<div style="height:auto;width:595px;color:#666;">
<figure class="module-poster"><img src=

<figcaption class="image-caption">Steam system</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>That steam is then cooled and condensed using a third system
that pumps in cold water from a body of water such as a lake or
reservoir. This is called the <strong>condenser cooling
system</strong>.</p>
<p>Like other components, the steam and condenser cooling systems
are regularly inspected.</p>
<p>These inspections take place throughout the life of the nuclear
facilities to confirm that aging equipment is functioning as
originally designed.</p>

height="237" width="595" />
<figcaption class="image-caption">Condenser cooling

</figure>
</div>
<br />
<h3>Shutdown cooling system</h3>
<p>A simpler cooling system is used when the reactor is shut down
for an extended period, for example during a planned outage.</p>
<p>It requires little power to function and is connected directly
to the heat transport system. It allows the primary coolant system
to be partly drained to perform inspection and maintenance work
(e.g., inspection of the steam generator tubes or replacement of
pump components).</p>
<h3>Multiple power supplies</h3>
<p>Cooling systems need electricity to operate. Under normal
operation, they get their electricity from the same power grid as
the rest of us.</p>
<p>Nuclear power plants in Canada are also equipped with multiple
sources of backup power if they get disconnected from the grid.</p>
<p>Sources of backup power include onsite power - that is, the
power produced by the plant itself.</p>
<p>In addition, the following are available:</p>
<div class="col-md-3 pull-right">
<figure class="module-poster"><img src=

</div>
<ul>
<li>two or three standby power generators</li>
<li>two or three emergency power generators</li>
<li>emergency batteries</li>
</ul>
<p>Some plants include even more equipment.</p>
<p>You can learn more by watching what would happen in the very
unlikely event of a <a href=
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vggzl9OngaM&amp;index=39&amp;list=PLymk-3kcglbgXzBG1Kh2zPO3pDL2TpPGt&amp;t=0s">
total station blackout</a> – the situation that led to the
Fukushima accident following the large tsunami that destroyed all
available power sources onsite.</p>
<h3>Natural circulation</h3>
<p>One of the inherent and proven safety features of CANDU reactors
is their ability to cool the reactor through natural
circulation.</p>
<p>In CANDU reactors, natural circulation takes over when the pumps
that normally push the coolant through the heat transport system
stop functioning.</p>
<p>For natural circulation to continue over time, steam generators
need to be filled with cool water.</p>
<h4><em>How does it work?</em></h4>
<p>This cooling feature of CANDU reactors works because of the
difference in temperature and elevation between the steam
generators (cooler and physically higher than the reactor core) and
the reactor core (hotter and lower than the steam generators)</p>
<h3>Emergency injection systems</h3>
<div class="col-md-3 pull-right">
<figure class="module-poster"><img src=
"./images/nuclear-power-plant-safety-systems-10.jpg" alt=
"Emergency pressurized nitrogen tanks" height="194" width="300" />
<figcaption class="image-caption">Emergency pressurized nitrogen
tanks</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>In the unlikely event of a loss of heavy water, which could, for
example, be caused by a pipe break, the emergency injection system
would ensure water continues to circulate over the containers
holding the fuel to cool it.</p>
<p>They would do this by working with pressurized tanks of nitrogen
or pumps.</p>
<p>A collection basin located in the basement of the reactor
building would recover the water and pump it back into the reactor
until repairs could be made.</p>
<h3>Emergency mitigation equipment</h3>

<figcaption class="image-caption">CNSC inspector verifying a

</figure>
</div>
<p>As one of the actions mandated by the CNSC following the
Fukushima accident, nuclear power plant operators in Canada have
been acquiring emergency mitigation equipment, such as portable
power generators and pumps, which could be used to bring reactors
to a safe shutdown state during a severe accident.</p>
<p>The equipment, located onsite and offsite, is easily transported
and could be used in several ways.</p>
<p>For instance, it could be used to stabilize reactors, supply
power to the control room and add water to the used nuclear fuel
pools so they could continue cooling the used nuclear fuel.</p>
<p class="text-right"><a href="#wb-main">Top of page</a></p>
<h2><a id="R4"></a>Containing radiation</h2>
<h3>Containment layers</h3>
<p>Nuclear reactors are built with multiple barriers to safely
contain radiation.<br /></p>
<p>At the heart of all CANDU reactors are hardened ceramic pellets
made of natural uranium.</p>
<p>These pellets contain the radiation. They form the first layer
of containment.</p>
<p>The pellets are enclosed in rods, which form the second layer of
containment. CANDU fuel rods are made of zircaloy, a metal alloy
extremely resistant to heat and corrosion.</p>
<p>The rods are then loaded into pressure tubes, which are part of
the heat transport system. This is the third layer of
containment.</p>
<p>The pressure tubes are contained inside a metal tank called the
calandria, which itself is contained inside a thick vault made of
reinforced concrete.</p>
<div style="height:auto;width:595px;color:#666;">
<figure class="module-poster"><img src=
"./images/nuclear-power-plant-safety-systems-12.png" alt=
"The image shows different layers of radiation containment, which include the fuel pellet, fuel rod and pressure tube. "
height="418" width="595" /></figure>
</div>
<p>The fourth layer of containment is the building that houses and
protects the reactor.</p>
<p>The walls of the reactor building are made of at least one metre
of reinforced concrete.</p>
<p>The reactor building is surrounded by an exclusion (buffer)
zone.</p>
<h3>Minimizing radiation releases</h3>
<p>During normal operation, nuclear power plants release very small
amounts of radiation into the air and water.</p>
<p>These releases come from the reactor and its system and from
waste management activities.</p>
<p>In order to reduce airborne releases, highly efficient filters
and radiation monitors are installed as part of the ventilation
systems.</p>
<p>Filters remove over 99% of the radiation from the air before it
is released to the environment.</p>
<p>Similar systems are also installed to remove radioactivity from
waterborne releases.</p>
<div class="col-md-3 pull-right">
<figure class="module-poster"><img src=
"./images/nuclear-power-plant-safety-systems-13.jpg" alt=
"Verification of radiation levels" height="190" width="300" />
<figcaption class="image-caption">CNSC inspector verifying
radiation levels</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>These releases usually come from wash water used to clean
surfaces, floors and laundry, as well as from water draining from
showers and sinks.</p>
<p>All radiation releases from nuclear facilities in Canada are
very small. They are monitored and controlled by the plant
operator, and reported to the CNSC.</p>
<p>The release levels are well below regulatory limits and do not
pose any risk to the health and safety of persons or the
environment.</p>
<p>Filtering systems are regularly inspected and power plant
operators must, by law, report all radioactive releases into the
environment.</p>
<h3>Protecting containment in case of an accident</h3>
<p>Safety systems are in place so that, in case of an accident,
they can protect the containment from internal pressure due to
steam releases inside the reactor building.</p>
<p>In a single-unit station, internal pressure would be lowered by
spraying water from a dousing tank.</p>
<div style="height:auto;width:301px;color:#666;">
<figure class="module-poster"><img src=

<figcaption class="image-caption">Cutaway view of CANDU single unit

</figure>
</div>
<p>In a multi-unit station, pressure would be lowered by releasing
steam and hot gases from the reactor building to the vacuum
building.</p>
<p>The vacuum building is a structure specifically designed to
quickly and safely lower pressure inside the reactor building. This
building also has a dousing system to control pressure.</p>
<p>The vacuum and dousing systems work without power and are tested
periodically under the supervision of CNSC inspectors.</p>

</div>
<p>Hydrogen gas can be produced during a severe accident. Hydrogen
gas, which is flammable, could cause an explosion and damage the
containment, as well as to personnel and other parts of the
plant.</p>
<p>To deal with the potential hazards of hydrogen gas, most CANDU
plants are equipped with hydrogen igniters or burners.</p>
<p>Recently, nuclear power plant operators have begun installing
passive autocatalytic recombiners.</p>
<p>These are devices which passively (without need for external
power) remove hydrogen from the containment and effectively reduce
the risk of an explosion or fire.</p>

<h2 id="R1">About</h2>
<p>A Pre-Licensing Vendor Design Review (VDR) is an optional
service provided by the CNSC when requested by a vendor.</p>
<p>A VDR is a feedback mechanism that enables CNSC staff to provide
feedback early in the design process based on a vendor's reactor
technology. Nuclear power plant designs can include small modular
reactor (SMR) concepts, advanced reactor concepts or more
traditional designs. The assessment is completed by the CNSC at the
request of the vendor. The word “pre-licensing” signifies that a
design review is undertaken prior to the submission of a licence
application to the CNSC by an applicant seeking to build and
operate a new nuclear power plant. An application by a vendor for a
review is <strong>not</strong> an application for a licence to
prepare a site or to construct or operate a nuclear power facility,
and is not an indication of intent to proceed with a project.</p>
<p>This review does not certify a reactor design or involve the
issuance of a licence under the <em>Nuclear Safety and Control
Act,</em> and it is not required as part of the licensing process
for a new nuclear power plant. The conclusions of any design review
do not bind or otherwise influence decisions made by the
Commission.</p>
<p>The objective of a review is to verify, at a high level, the
acceptability of a nuclear power plant design with respect to
Canadian nuclear regulatory requirements and expectations, as well
as Canadian codes and standards. These reviews also identify
fundamental barriers to licensing a new design in Canada and
assures that a resolution path exists for any design issues
identified in the review.</p>
<p>A vendor who has completed a Phase 2 Pre-Licensing VDR, has
committed to increased regulatory efficiencies at the time of
licensing. The results of Phase 2 will be taken into account mainly
for the Construction Licence Application and is likely to result in
increased efficiencies of technical reviews.</p>
<p>The reviews take place in three phases, each of which is
conducted against related CNSC regulatory documents and Canadian
codes &amp; standards:</p>
<p id="p1">Phase 1: Pre-Licensing Assessment of Compliance with
Regulatory Requirements: This phase involves an overall assessment
of the vendor's nuclear power plant design against the most recent
CNSC design requirements for new nuclear power plants in Canada as
indicated in <a href=
"/eng/acts-and-regulations/regulatory-documents/published/html/regdoc2-5-2/index.cfm">
REGDOC-2.5.2, <em>Design Of Reactor Facilities: Nuclear Power
Plants</em></a> or <a href=
"/eng/acts-and-regulations/regulatory-documents/published/html/rd367/index.cfm">
<em>Design of Small Reactor Facilities</em> (RD-367)</a> as
applicable, as well as all other related CNSC regulatory documents
and Canadian codes &amp; standards.</p>
<p id="p2">Phase 2: Pre-Licensing Assessment for Any Potential
Fundamental Barriers to Licensing: This phase goes into further
details with a focus on identifying any potential fundamental
barriers to licensing the vendor's nuclear power plant design in
Canada.</p>
<p id="p3">Phase 3: Follow-up: This phase allows the vendor to
follow-up on certain aspects of Phase 2 findings by:</p>
<ul>
<li>seeking more information from the CNSC about a Phase 2 topic;
and/or</li>
<li>asking the CNSC to review activities taken by the vendor
towards the reactor's design readiness, following the completion of
Phase 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regulatory decisions are not based on pre-licensing VDRs.
Consequently, CNSC staff must balance the obligation to protect a
vendor’s sensitive commercial information with the need to access
this information so that they can conduct effective reviews and
report on their work to the public transparently. To do so, CNSC
staff prepare an executive summary of the overall conclusions and
key findings of its pre-licensing VDR and post it for public
information. Details of discussions and review results are released
at the vendor’s discretion.</p>
<p>For more Information on the CNSC's pre-licensing VDR, please
refer to&nbsp;<a href=
"/eng/acts-and-regulations/regulatory-documents/published/html/regdoc3-5-4/index.cfm">REGDOC-3.5.4,
Pre-Licensing Review of a Vendor’s Reactor Design</a>.</p>
<h2>Pre-licensing vendor design reviews are carried out within a
service agreement</h2>
<p>A service agreement is a legal document that establishes the
terms and conditions between the CNSC and a reactor vendor. These
terms and conditions enable the CNSC to conduct a pre-licensing VDR
in accordance with the <em>Nuclear Safety and Control Act</em> and
its regulations. The agreement serves as a mechanism for:</p>
<ul>
<li>preserving the CNSC’s regulatory independence by reinforcing
the fact the review being undertaken:
<ul>
<li>does not certify a reactor design.</li>
<li>does not involve the issuance of a licence under the
<em>Nuclear Safety and Control Act</em>.</li>
<li>is not required as part of the licensing process for a new
nuclear power plant; the conclusions of any design review do not
bind or otherwise influence future decisions made by the
Commission.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>recovering costs from effort expended by CNSC staff</li>
<li>ensuring that the objectives and conduct of a review remain
consistent from one vendor to the next, thereby ensuring fairness
of treatment</li>
<li>striking a balance between, on the one hand, protecting a
vendor’s sensitive commercial information and, on the other hand,
providing CNSC staff access to this information for the purposes of
performing an effective review and transparently communicating the
CNSC’s activities to the public, to the extent practicable</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="R2">Status of pre-licensing vendor design reviews</h2>
<p>Participating vendors and their review completion dates are
outlined below. Please note that planned completion dates for
current reviews may be adjusted as needed by mutual agreement.</p>
<h2 id="R3">Current pre-licensing vendor design reviews</h2>
<p>The following table presents an overview of vendors who have
established service agreements with the CNSC for pre-licensing
engagement using the VDR process for their new reactor designs.</p>
<p>The duration of each review is estimated based on the vendor’s
proposed schedule. A Phase 1 review typically takes 12–18 months
and a Phase 2 review takes 24 months.</p>
<p>At the end of the review for each phase, an executive summary of
the project report will be posted on this Web page.</p>

<p>The following table presents an overview of vendors who have
applied for service agreements with the CNSC to conduct a VDR for
their new reactor designs. Although it typically takes a few months
for the CNSC to establish and sign a service agreement, this time
period can vary, depending on:</p>
<ul>
<li>the organizational and technical readiness of the vendor</li>
<li>sufficient completeness of the vendor’s design activities for
the Phase of VDR applied for</li>
<li>the vendor’s financial readiness to undertake the VDR</li>
<li>other legal, timing or business aspects that may influence a
vendor’s decision to proceed</li>
</ul>
<p>The CNSC does not provide details on a vendor’s decision to
enter or complete the VDR process.&nbsp;For additional information,
contact the vendor directly.</p>

<title>Phase 1 pre-licensing vendor design review executive
summary: Moltex Energy</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Moltex Energy is designing a 300 MWe (750 MWth) molten salt
reactor, the SSR-W300. The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission
(CNSC), as Canada’s nuclear regulator, under the authority of the
<em>Nuclear Safety and Control Act</em>, entered into an agreement
with Moltex Energy on November 16, 2017, to conduct a Phase 1
pre-licensing vendor design review (VDR) of the SSR W300 molten
salt reactor. The VDR process is described in regulatory document
REGDOC 3.5.4, <em>Pre-Licensing Review of a Vendor’s Reactor
Design</em>.</p>
<p>The VDR is an optional service that the CNSC provides at the
request of a vendor. It is a high-level review of the proposed
reactor technology’s design information against Canadian regulatory
requirements and guidance. The service does not involve the
issuance of a licence under the <em>Nuclear Safety and Control
Act</em> and is not part of the licensing process. The conclusions
of such a review do not bind or otherwise influence decisions made
by the Commission. The CNSC’s licensing processes will require a
more detailed review of the design and safety case for a specific
licence application at a specific site.</p>
<p>A Phase 1 VDR determines whether, at a general level, the
vendor’s reactor design and design processes demonstrate
implementation of CNSC regulatory requirements. It is intended to
provide early feedback to the vendor on matters relating to CNSC
regulatory requirements and expectations. This can allow for early
identification and resolution of potential regulatory or technical
issues in the design and design process, particularly those that
could result in significant changes to the design.</p>
<p>This Phase 1 report outlines the CNSC staff review process, the
assessment findings, and the conclusions of the review.</p>
<h3>Application of REGDOC-2.5.2</h3>
<p>REGDOC-2.5.2, <em>Design of Reactor Facilities: Nuclear Power
Plants</em>, was written to be technology-neutral to the extent
practicable. However, the document contains requirements and
guidance that incorporate extensive operating experience from the
use of water-cooled reactors. It is recognized that vendors of
specific technologies may present alternative technological
approaches and methodologies; however, alternative approaches
remain subject to the same safety objectives, high-level safety
concepts and safety management principles articulated in CNSC
design and safety analysis documents such as REGDOC-2.5.2 and
supporting documentation. Technical expertise, professional
judgment and adequately documented processes can also be used to
ensure that the application of, or departure from, regulatory
requirements is objective and consistent so that the required level
of safety is achieved.</p>
<h3>Phase 1 vendor design review results</h3>
<p>The Moltex Phase 1 VDR was carried out at the request of the
vendor, over a 42-month period. Moltex Energy submitted 50
documents broken up into 8 work packages to cover the 19 technical
review focus areas. Moltex Energy also provided familiarization
sessions, responses to requests for additional information, and
technical clarifications through letters, emails and meetings.
Based on the documentation submitted, CNSC staff concluded the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overall, Moltex Energy understands and has correctly
interpreted the high-level intent of the CNSC’s regulatory
requirements for the design of nuclear power plants in Canada
within the scope of the Phase 1 VDR.</li>
<li>In several instances, owing to the unique characteristics of
the reactor design, Moltex Energy is proposing alternative
approaches and methodologies to address the underlying intent of
CNSC regulatory requirements, in accordance with section 11 of
REGDOC-2.5.2. Moltex Energy has indicated that it intends to
adequately justify the use of these alternative approaches, and
understands that it will be expected to provide evidence that these
alternative approaches will result in an equivalent or superior
level of safety.</li>
<li>Moltex Energy will be required to do additional work to address
the findings raised in this review. These are discussed below.</li>
<li>The design of the SSR-W300 evolved throughout the Phase 1 VDR
and may continue to evolve. Any changes to the design must be
documented and described in detail for any future review.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following points are a summary of clarifications or findings
that will require additional follow-up in a future review:</p>
<ol>
<li>The management system documentation submitted by Moltex Energy
does not yet show sufficient systematic processes to support its
ongoing design development activities. It was noted, though, that
Moltex Energy is implementing a number of improvements to its
management system. As a result, additional information will be
needed in Phase 2 to confirm that Moltex Energy’s updated
management system processes to control design, safety analysis, and
research and development activities meet the intent of requirements
and expectations set out in applicable regulatory documents and
standards.</li>
<li>The safety classification of structures, systems and components
(SSCs) in the SSR-W300 design has not yet been linked to the
quality assurance programs. Similarly, the safety classification
methodology submitted has not yet been fully developed to provide
information as to how sub-classifications are established. In Phase
2, the vendor will need to establish and demonstrate, using
examples, the relationship between the safety classification
designation and engineering design rules in order to ensure that
SSCs are designed, manufactured, constructed, installed,
commissioned, operated, tested, inspected and maintained such that
their quality and reliability are commensurate with the
classification.</li>
<li>Moltex Energy takes the position that a secondary control room
is not needed in the design. While the proposal of an alternative
approach is acceptable, Moltex has not yet justified that such an
approach will have at least an equivalent level of safety. Such a
justification will be required for any Phase 2 review.</li>
<li>The SSR-W300 design includes 2 novel means of shutdown. Limited
information was provided regarding the reliability of these means
for all operating states, their capability to safely reduce the
reactor to low power levels, and their ability to put the reactor
in a guaranteed shutdown state. Such information is expected for a
Phase 2 review.</li>
<li>The containment structures presented by the vendor are still at
a conceptual level. The capability of the structures to respond to
accident scenarios, including design-basis and beyond-design-basis
threats, are not discussed. Such information is expected for a
Phase 2 review.</li>
<li>Given the novelty of some of the SSR-W300 design and safety
features, in Phase 2 additional information will be required to
confirm:
<ul>
<li>the interface requirements between SSCs of different safety
classifications</li>
<li>the adequacy of the research and development activities to
substantiate the fuel qualification program, including the role of
a first-of-a-kind reactor</li>
<li>the validation and verification of the capability of the
software tools to model the reactor and to analyze the reactor
behaviour under all operating modes</li>
<li>the functionality, adequacy and reliability of inherent and
passive safety systems and components claimed in the safety case
for the reactor</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Notwithstanding the above, these issues are foreseen to be
resolvable and will be followed up on in future phases of the
VDR.</p>

<h2>Emergency preparedness</h2>
<p>The CNSC requires nuclear power plants to conduct a full-scale
emergency exercise every three years to test emergency response
plans, decision-making functions, response capabilities and
interoperability. The goal is to test the licensee, response
agencies, and municipal, provincial and federal government
responders’ ability to mitigate the impact of a nuclear
accident.</p>
<p>If you live within 50 km of the Bruce Power Nuclear Generating
Station, you will have received information about what to do in the
unlikely event of a nuclear accident from Bruce Power. For more
information visit <a href=
"http://www.bepreparedgreybrucehuron.com/nuclear/"><em>Be Prepared
Grey Bruce Huron.</em></a> When you receive this information, read
it carefully and store it in an easily accessible place. You can
also attend public information sessions held by local authorities
and Bruce Power. &nbsp;For more information on CNSC requirements,

<p>As with any emergency, you can prepare your family by:</p>
<ul>

<h2 id="a2">Periodic safety review</h2>
<p>A periodic safety review (PSR) is an international best practice
that was adopted by the CNSC in 2015. In addition to the overall
safety performance review of licensees, which incorporates reviews
of several safety factors, a PSR requires a comprehensive review of
plant design and processes. The purpose is to compare current
design with modern codes and standards to identify reasonable and
practical plant or program modifications to enhance safety and
enable safe, long-term operation.</p>
<p>As part of licensing conditions set out by the CNSC, PSRs are
conducted every 10 years at all Canadian nuclear power plants.</p>
<p>CNSC regulatory document REGDOC-2.3.3, <em>Periodic Safety
Reviews</em>, requires the PSR to be conducted in four phases. Each
phase is thoroughly reviewed by CNSC staff prior to accepting the
document and proceeding to the next phase:</p>
<ul>
<li>PSR basis document, an agreement between Bruce Power and the
CNSC on how the PSR will be achieved. (Bruce A and Bruce B)</li>
<li>Conduct of the safety factors reviews and identification of
findings (Bruce A and Bruce B)</li>
<li>Analysis of the findings and their integral impact on the NPP's
safety (global assessment report or GAR)</li>
<li>Preparation of a safety improvements plan (integrated
implementation plan)</li>
</ul>
<p>All PSR documents are available through <a href=

<h2 id="a3">Environmental risk assessment</h2>
<p>An environmental risk assessment (ERA) is a systematic process
used to identify, quantify and characterize the risk posed by
contaminants and physical stressors in the environment to
biological receptors, including humans.</p>
<p>The ERA for Bruce Power assessed the potential risks for the
current whole-site operation, both Bruce A and Bruce B generating
stations and additional facilities, to determine the potential
risks to the environment and human health from current operations.
Bruce Power's ERA also included a predictive environment risk
assessment for continued operations including major component
replacement.</p>
<p>Bruce Power's ERA is available on <a href=

<h2 id="a4">Bruce A refurbishment and continued operations
follow-up monitoring program</h2>
<p>Although the formal environmental assessment (EA) process
related to the life extension project of Bruce Power's units 1–4
concluded in July 2006, a follow-up monitoring program was
established to verify the predictions that were made in the EA.
Bruce Power provided annual updates to the CNSC on the status of
the project until the conclusion of the follow-up monitoring
program in 2015. CNSC staff reviewed the reports and concluded that
most of the predictions made in the EA that were part of the EA
follow-up monitoring program have been verified in that there have
been no significant adverse environmental effects as a result of
the refurbishment projects. The results were inconclusive for two
elements: substrate temperatures of the thermal plume and impacts
to fish and the population level impacts on Deepwater Sculpin from
cooling water intake. Additional work on these elements will be
addressed within the ERA and follow-up monitoring program.</p>

<h3>Ontario Power Generation Deep Geologic Repository</h3>
<p>The site preparation, construction and operation of a Deep
Geologic Repository (DGR) is proposed for the disposal of low- and
intermediate-level radioactive wastes on the Bruce Site in
Tiverton. The DGR will also hold waste produced from the continued
operation of the Bruce, Pickering and Darlington nuclear generating
stations.</p>
<p>Find out more about the <a href=
"/eng/resources/status-of-new-nuclear-projects/deep-geologic-repository/index.cfm">
status of this project</a>.</p>
<h3>Western Waste Management Facility</h3>
<p>The Western Waste Management Facility is owned and operated by
Ontario Power Generation (OPG) and stores low level radioactive
wastes from the Bruce A and B reactors as well as from the
Pickering and Darlington nuclear generating stations. The Western
Waste Management Facility also houses used fuel from Bruce A and B
along with refurbishment waste from Bruce A.</p>
<h3>Douglas Point Waste Facility</h3>
<p>The Douglas Point Waste Facility (DPWF) is located at the site
of the former Douglas Point Nuclear Generating Station situated on
the Bruce nuclear site. Decommissioning of this prototype reactor
began in 1986, and the transfer of spent fuel from wet storage in
the reactor pool to a dedicated dry storage facility was completed
by 1987. The DPWF is presently in the storage-with-surveillance
phase of a deferred decommissioning program.</p>
<h3>Bruce Heavy Water Plant</h3>
<p>The Bruce Heavy Water Plant (BHWP) was a Class 1B nuclear
facility contained within the boundaries of the Bruce nuclear site
located in Tiverton, Ontario. It began producing heavy water in
1973 and continued until the last production facilities were shut
down in 1998. The demolition of the BHWP was completed in 2006. All
contaminated soil has been remediated, and the project is in the
end-state of environmental monitoring.</p>

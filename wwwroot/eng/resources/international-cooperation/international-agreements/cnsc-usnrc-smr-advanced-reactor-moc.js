<h2>Memorandum of Cooperation on Advanced Reactor and Small Modular Reactor Technologies between the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission and the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission</h2>
<p>WHEREAS, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) and the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC), both hereinafter referred to as the Participants, have a mutual interest in exchanging information pertaining to advanced reactor and small modular reactor (SMR) technologies; </p>
<p>WHEREAS, the Participants are already engaged in general cooperation in nuclear safety matters under the Memorandum of Understanding Between the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission and the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the Exchange of Technical Information and Cooperation in Nuclear Safety Matters, signed at Rockville and Ottawa on August 7 and 9, 2017 (the MOU); </p>
<p>THEREFORE, the CNSC and the USNRC intend this Memorandum of Cooperation (MOC) to further expand their cooperation under the provisions of the MOU on activities associated with advanced reactor and SMR technologies. Accordingly, the CNSC and the USRNC intend to cooperate under the MOU as follows: </p>
<ol>
<li>Current and new cooperation on advanced reactor and SMR technologies is intended to occur under the auspices of the CNSC-USNRC Steering Committee, established by mutual decision by charter dated August 10, 2017. The Steering Committee is expected to meet annually to discuss specific cooperative opportunities for this project.</li>  	<li>To further strengthen the CNSC and USNRC commitment to share best practices and experience reviewing advanced reactor and SMR technology designs. Cooperation on these reviews may expand to facilitate a joint technical review of an advanced reactor or SMR design. This may include cooperation in the following areas:
<ol>
<li>Development of shared advanced reactor and SMR technical review approaches that facilitate resolution of common technical questions to facilitate regulatory reviews that address each Participant&rsquo;s national regulations;</li>
<li>Collaboration on pre-application activities to ensure mutual preparedness to efficiently review advanced reactor and SMR designs; and</li>
<li>Collaboration on research, training, and in the development of regulatory approaches to address unique and novel technical considerations for ensuring the safety of advanced reactors and SMRs. </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Cooperation between the CNSC and the USNRC under this MOC is intended to supplement and strengthen the existing cooperation between the CNSC and the USNRC under the MOU, which the CNSC and the USNRC intend to continue.</p>
<h2>Administrative Matters</h2>
<ul className="list-lower-alpha">  	<li>This MOC may be modified by the mutual written consent of both Participants.</li>  	<li>This MOC becomes effective upon signature by both Participants and remains effective until either Participant provides written notice to the other Participant of its intent to cease cooperation under this MOC. A Participant is expected to provide at least 180 days advance written notice to the other of its intent to cease cooperation under this MOC.</li>  	<li>All information protected under this MOC is expected to continue to be protected consistent with the terms of the MOU after this MOC has expired or cooperation under it has ceased, unless the Participants jointly determine otherwise in writing.</li>
</ul>

In accordance with the MOU, the Participants established the USNRC-CNSC Steering Committee for Nuclear Safety and Security Cooperation (the USNRC-CNSC Steering Committee) on August 10, 2017.</p>  <p>The activities under the MOC are to be coordinated by a subcommittee of the USNRC-CNSC Steering Committee, which is to be known as the Advanced Reactor Technologies and Small Modular Reactors Sub Committee (the ART-SMR Sub Committee). Each work plan to accomplish specific cooperative activities under the MOC will be approved and prioritized by the ART-SMR Sub Committee. The ART-SMR Sub Committee will assess progress of activities, deliverables, and new work plans at least bi-annually or as needed for timely decision-making. </p>  <p>The USNRC and the CNSC are mature and agile nuclear regulatory bodies that jointly recognize the need for leadership in efficient and effective oversight of advanced reactor and SMR technologies. The Participants acknowledge the differences in each country&#8217;s regulatory frameworks and licensing processes, while seeking to leverage fundamental scientific and engineering findings from each other&#8217;s reviews to the extent practical. </p>  <p>The MOC does not in any way change the national regulatory requirements of either country or fetter licensing decision-making. The cooperative activities related to the review of the technologies are subject to the terms and conditions in the agreements between the Participants and reactor design developers.</p>  <h2 id="sec3">Application of the Terms of Reference</h2>  <p>Cooperation under the MOC pertains to regulatory activities associated with advanced reactor and SMR technologies. These Terms of Reference apply, but are not limited to, cooperative activities on: </p>  <ul> <li>nuclear reactors (nuclear fission or fusion reactors) that produce energy</li>  <li>water-cooled or non-water cooled (i.e. with alternative coolant technologies) reactors</li>  <li>development of shared advanced reactor and SMR technical review approaches that facilitate resolution of common technical questions to facilitate regulatory reviews that address each country&#8217;s national regulations</li>  <li>collaboration on pre-application activities<sup id="fnb1-ref"><a className="fn-lnk" href="#fnb1"><span className="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup> to ensure mutual preparedness to efficiently review advanced reactor and SMR designs</li>  <li>collaboration on research, training, and in the development of regulatory approaches to address unique and novel technical considerations for ensuring the safety of advanced reactors and SMRs.</li>  </ul> <h2 id="sec4">Desired Outputs</h2>  <p>The outputs of this cooperation may include, but are not limited to:</p>  <ul>  <li>Collaboration on technical reviews leading to:  	<ul> 	<li>Identification and documentation of specific areas of common focus and agreement on acceptability in view of respective safety frameworks</li>  	<li>Documentation of specific elements of the design where either regulator identified safety concerns.</li>  	</ul></li> <li>Exploration of opportunities for joint research in areas where further research and development could benefit both regulators</li>  <li>Collaboration in oversight of research or testing activities related to ongoing or expected regulatory review activities intended to be submitted to both regulators for review</li>  <li>Joint participation in inspections, especially vendor inspections, related to ongoing or expected regulatory review activities intended to be submitted to both regulators for review</li>  <li>Sharing independent regulatory review results, seeking to identify possible areas of potential alignment in regulatory approaches and framework.</li>  </ul>  <p>The cooperative activities under this MOC are intended to:</p>  <ul> <li>Contribute to better use of regulator&#8217;s resources by leveraging the technical knowledge and resources between the USNRC and the CNSC</li>  <li>Enhance the depth and breadth of understanding of the respective staff of the CNSC and USNRC on the counterpart nation&#8217;s regulatory review activities and requirements</li>  <li>Enhance the joint opportunities for learning and understanding the advanced reactor and SMR technologies being reviewed.</li>  </ul> <p>In addition, deliverables associated with specific cooperation activities will be described in the work plans. Examples of specific cooperation activities are included in Annex A.</p>  <h2 id="sec5">Administration of the ART-SMR Sub Committee</h2>  <p>Both Participants will appoint one primary lead (Co-Chair) for all activities under the MOC. These leads will serve as the primary interface with the USNRC-CNSC Steering Committee and will lead the overall activities of the ART-SMR Sub Committee. Both Participants will appoint one primary lead for each work plan. These work plan leads will serve as the primary interface with the ART-SMR Sub Committee.</p>  <p>The ART-SMR Sub Committee members are as follows:</p>  <table className="">

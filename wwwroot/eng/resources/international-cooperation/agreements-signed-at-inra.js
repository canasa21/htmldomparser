<p>The CNSC has signed an arrangement for cooperation and the exchange of technical information in nuclear  regulatory matters with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. </p>
<p>This arrangement concerns areas such as standards for health safety, security, safeguards and the  protection of the environment with respect to nuclear facilities and  fissionable and radioactive substances.</p>
<p>This is a renewal of an existing agreement and reflects a mutual interest in exchanging technical information relating to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. This  agreement reaffirms the close nuclear cooperation between our two countries. The arrangement was signed in Ottawa on April 17, 2012. </p>
<p>These types of MoUs and arrangements:</p>
<ul>
<li>describe how regulators will exchange information and training</li>
<li>facilitate the sharing of information and personnel connected to licensing and regulatory supervision of nuclear installations,  storage of treatment of radioactive waste, as well as other matters related to  the peaceful use of nuclear energy</li>
<li>emphasize the priority that signatories assign to nuclear safety and the regulation of nuclear activities</li>
</ul>
<p>The CNSC maintains similar MoUs with nuclear regulators in Argentina, Australia, Finland,  France, Indonesia, Israel,  Jordan, Romania, Russia,  South Africa and the United Kingdom. </p>

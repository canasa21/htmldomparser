</ul>
<p>Part of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission&#39;s (CNSC)  mandate is to implement international obligations on the peaceful use of  nuclear materials and technology to which Canada has agreed. To achieve this  objective, the CNSC works bilaterally and multilaterally with partners around the world to maintain a safe, secure and peaceful international nuclear sector.</p>
<h2 id="Introduction">Types of international instruments</h2>
<p>International instruments comprise a variety of  documents. They include treaties, agreements, conventions, charters, protocols,  declarations, memoranda of understanding and exchanges of notes. </p>
<p>A treaty is &quot;an international agreement concluded  between States in written form and governed by international law, whether  embodied in a single instrument, or in two or more related instruments and  whatever its particular designation&quot; (Vienna Convention on the Law of  Treaties). Treaties are most commonly referred to as Treaty, Convention, Agreement or Protocol. An exchange of diplomatic notes or letters can also be a treaty. </p>
<p>Governments use non-legally binding instruments in  international relations to express political and moral commitments as opposed to undertakings governed by public international law. These instruments are  usually entitled &quot;memoranda of understanding&quot; or  &quot;arrangements&quot;.</p>
<h3>Nuclear Cooperation Agreement (NCA)</h3>
<p>Canada&#39;s non-proliferation policy stipulates that  Canadian-supplied nuclear material, equipment and technology may only be  transferred to countries with which Canada has concluded a bilateral NCA. NCAs establish reciprocated obligations to minimize risk associated with  major nuclear items. These include assurances that exports are properly  protected, safely handled and used for peaceful purposes, and that Canada maintains control over nuclear exports.</p>
<h3>Administrative arrangement (AA) pursuant to NCA</h3>
<p>Canada&#39;s NCAs contain a provision authorizing the CNSC as  the appropriate government authority on the part of Canada to establish AAs to  facilitate the effective implementation of an NCA.</p>
<h3>Administrative arrangement (AA) on the import and export of radioactive sources</h3>
<p>These  non-legally binding bilateral arrangements between the CNSC and foreign  regulatory counterparts implement key import and export control provisions of  the IAEA <a href="http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/Code-2004_web.pdf">Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources (the Code)</a>, and the supplementary <a href="http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/Imp-Exp_web.pdf">Guidance  on the Import and Export of Radioactive Sources (the Guidance)</a>. The  objective of the AAs is to establish efficient and harmonized bilateral  procedures for the implementation of import and export controls, thus reducing  the risk of undue delays in authorizing transfers of such sources.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Memorandum of understanding (MOU)</h3>
<p>An MOU, under section 21(1)( a) of the <em>Nuclear Safety and Control Act</em> (NSCA), empowers the CNSC to enter into arrangements with any regulatory agency or department of a government or any international agency. These arrangements provide a framework for bilateral cooperation, and provide parties with assurances regarding the security of information exchanged, as well as enhanced clarity about responsibilities regarding visits and costs related to cooperation initiatives, among other benefits. While these arrangements are not legally binding, they nonetheless represent serious political commitments</p>

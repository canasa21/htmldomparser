<h2>December 2010, Revision 2</h2>  	<div className="alert alert-info">
<ul>
<li>Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) and the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) have signed a protocol for National Research Universal (NRU) licensing activities. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The protocol establishes a framework to prepare the necessary information for the CNSC to assess the continued operation of the NRU reactor beyond the current licence period. The NRU licence expires October 31, 2011. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Licensing activities for NRU will take place within the wider context of the licence renewal for Chalk River Laboratories, taking into account the <a href="http://publications.gc.ca/gazette/archives/p2/2007/2007-12-26/pdf/g2-14126.pdf">Directive to CNSC</a>, issued by the Governor in Council. The CNSC will take into account the health of Canadians who, for medical purposes, depend on nuclear substances produced by NRU as an input for evaluating various licensing options, while protecting the health, safety and security of Canadians and the environment. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Revision 2 of the protocol signed in December 2010 replaces Revision 1 of the protocol signed in January 2010. </li>

Nothing in this protocol or any statement in this protocol is to be construed or interpreted as affecting the jurisdiction and discretion of the Commission in any assessment of any application for licensing purposes under the <em>Nuclear Safety and Control Act</em> (NSCA). It is not intended to constitute a deviation or inference to a proposed amendment to the current licence for the National Research Universal (NRU).</p>  	<p>This revision reflects that developments in NRU Integrated Safety Review (ISR) management and process that have occurred since the initiation of the original protocol <a href="#note1" id="return1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. </p>  	<p className="text-right"><a href="#wb-main"><span className="wb-icon-nav-090-alt"></span>Top of page</a></p>  	<a id="obj"></a>  	<h2>1. Objective</h2>  	<p>The objective of this protocol is to provide a framework within which AECL and CNSC staff will work to prepare the necessary information for the Commission to assess the continued operation of the NRU reactor beyond the current licence period. NRU is operated under the nuclear research and test establishment operating licence for Chalk River Laboratories<a href="#note2" id="return2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>that expires October 31, 2011. Licensing activities for NRU will take place within the wider context of licence renewal for Chalk River Laboratories, taking into account the directive from the Governor in Council to consider the health of Canadians as it relates to the production of medical isotopes as an input for evaluating various options, without compromising safety.</p>  	<p className="text-right"><a href="#wb-main"><span className="wb-icon-nav-090-alt"></span>Top of page</a></p>  	<a id="intro"></a>  	<h2>2. Introduction</h2>  	<p>The legal framework for licence renewal is derived from the <em>Nuclear Safety and Control Act</em> (NSCA) <a href="#note3" id="return3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> and supporting regulations.</p>  	<p>Following the directive <a href="#note4" id="return4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> from the Governor in Council in considering all the risk to Canadians, the AECL and CNSC staff are coordinating their effort for the licensing of the NRU to meet the mandates and accountability responsibilities of both organizations.</p>  	<p>In engaging in this coordinated effort and working responsibly in the public interest, the CNSC maintains its independence as the Canadian nuclear regulator and AECL continues to be solely responsible for the safe operation of the NRU reactor.</p>  	<p>It is understood that:</p>  	<ul>
<li>safety will not be compromised in making licensing recommendations to the Commission </li>
<li>the licensing activities will be conducted on a best effort basis to minimize, to the extent possible, disruption of the production of medical isotopes</li>
<li>the objective is to produce a comprehensive body of information and recommendations to allow the Commission to render its decision regarding the application for a licence renewal</li>  	</ul>  	<p>This protocol sets out the framework within which both organizations will work and establishes a high level estimate of the timeline. </p>  	<p className="text-right"><a href="#wb-main"><span className="wb-icon-nav-090-alt"></span>Top of page</a></p>  	<a id="approach"></a>  	<h2>3. Approach to licensing</h2>  	<p>To fully address the responsibilities for safety and accountability, and to serve the Canadian public, both the CNSC and Atomic Energy of Canada Limited recognize the importance of a well-planned and coordinated working arrangement. </p>  	<p>Both organizations recognize the complexity of the matter and agree to implement an integrated safety review (ISR) of the facility. The ISR process for NRU will be fully defined at an early stage of the work process. It will rely on the guidance set out in the IAEA Safety Guide: Periodic Safety Review of Nuclear Power Plants <a href="#note5" id="return5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>, and the CNSC regulatory document: <em>Life Extension of Nuclear Power Plants</em> <a href="#note6" id="return6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>, recognizing that NRU is a research facility approaching licence renewal not a power plant undergoing life extension.</p>  	<p>This protocol also addresses the completion of remaining activities from the restart protocol considered of high relevance<a href="#note7" id="return7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>  	<p className="text-right"><a href="#wb-main"><span className="wb-icon-nav-090-alt"></span>Top of page</a></p>  	<a id="schedule"></a>  	<h2>4. Schedule</h2>  	<p>The schedule set out in the statement of work in this protocol is intended to align with the timeline for the site licence renewal in 2011 and the lead time notices required in the <em>Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission Rules of Procedure</em>.</p>  	<p>It is recognized that the schedule includes a large amount of work and there may be execution risks that could cause delays. To preserve the completion of the objectives, the delay risks will be dealt with in a timely manner through adjustments of resources or the time line of this protocol. These adjustments will be made through the protocol revision process outlined below.</p>  	<p className="text-right"><a href="#wb-main"><span className="wb-icon-nav-090-alt"></span>Top of page</a></p>  	<a id="rnr"></a>  	<h2>5.

Statement of work</h2>  	<h3>NRU Integrated Safety Review (ISR)</h3>  	<p>This set of NRU ISR high level tasks / milestones are derived from the ISR process documented in RD-360. It is recognized that work performed in support of relicensing in 2005 and 2006 provides a basis for a comprehensive ISR. The work described in this protocol builds on that basis. This protocol defines the high-level structure of the ISR process that will be followed. An early activity was to gather the necessary information to form a complete Level I plan, with milestones and deliverables.</p>  	<h3>Restart protocol</h3>  	<p>There were several items in the restart protocol considered of high relevance that require follow-up post return to service<a href="#note7b" id="return7b"><sup>[7b]</sup></a>.

Conflict resolution process</h3>  	<p>CNSC staff and AECL staff have agreed to coordinate licensing work related to NRU operation beyond 2011 under the <em>Nuclear Safety and Control Act</em>. Disagreements may arise during the execution of the work. A review and dispute resolution mechanism will be used during the review to ensure fairness and assist timely completion.</p>  	<p><strong>Step 1: Identification of the issue &amp; resolution at the staff level</strong></p>  	<ol>
<li> Monthly AECL/CNSC review meetings will be held to review progress and highlight any potential major issues or disputes. </li>
<li> The framework for a decision on an issue will be the government policies on regulatory effectiveness and the licensing requirements stated in, or referenced in, the ISR basis document, once this has been agreed to by both parties. </li>
<li> It is the intention of both parties to resolve issues at this level.</li>
<li> If an issue cannot be resolved at this level, it will be documented (typically, a brief factual summary of the issue and a paragraph representing the view of each organization) by the individuals in Paragraph 1 within two weeks of failure to resolve, and forwarded to the senior management level (step 2).</li>  	</ol>  	<p><strong>Step 2: Resolution at the senior management level </strong></p>  	<ol>
<li> A step 1 issue, once documented, will be provided to the Director General, Directorate of Nuclear Cycle and Facilities Regulations (CNSC), the Director General, Assessment and Analysis (CNSC), the General Manager Programs and Nuclear Oversight (AECL), and the Vice President and General Manager CRL Operations (AECL) for resolution. A meeting will be called, normally within 30 days, to resolve the issue, and the resolution documented.</li>
<li> Issues that cannot be resolved at this level will be referred to the Executive Vice-President level (step 3) within two weeks, supported by the original or revised documentation from step 1.</li>  	</ol>  	<p><strong>Step 3: Resolution at the executive level</strong></p>  	<p>A step 2 issue, with documentation, will be sent to the Executive Vice President, Regulatory Operations Branch (CNSC) and the Senior Vice President and Chief Nuclear Officer (AECL) for resolution. A meeting will be called, normally within 30 days, to resolve the issue, and the resolution documented.</p>  	<p className="text-right"><a href="#wb-main"><span className="wb-icon-nav-090-alt"></span>Top of page</a></p>  	<a id="rrp"></a>  	<h2>8.

Extended outage impact on the NRU ISR</h2>  	<p>The extended outage associated with repair of the NRU vessel leak and NRU return to service has had an impact on the NRU ISR. As part of the Extended Activities Program (EAP), some refurbishment work has been performed on NRU that otherwise would not necessarily have been completed prior to finishing the NRU ISR. As a result, some of the recommendations that would have come from the global assessment have already been addressed (e.g., vessel refurbishment, establishing a detailed vessel fitness for service program, heavy water moderator replacement, process water system refurbishment and heavy water system inspections).</p>  	<p className="text-right"><a href="#wb-main"><span className="wb-icon-nav-090-alt"></span>Top of page</a></p>

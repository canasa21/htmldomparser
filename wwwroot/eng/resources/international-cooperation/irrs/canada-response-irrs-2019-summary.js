<p>At the request of the Government of Canada,  an international team of senior nuclear and radiation safety experts met with  representatives of the Government of Canada from 3 to 13 September 2019 to  conduct an Integrated Regulatory Review Service (IRRS) mission.</p>
<p> Participating authorities included the  Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC), Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) and  Health Canada (HC).</p>
<p> The mission took place in Ottawa, Canada.  The purpose of the IRRS mission was to perform a peer review of Canada&rsquo;s  regulatory framework for nuclear and radiation safety against IAEA safety  standards as the international benchmark for safety. The mission was also used  to exchange information and experience between the IRRS team members and the  Canadian counterparts in the areas covered by the IRRS.</p>
<p> The IRRS team consisted of 20 senior  regulatory experts from 17 IAEA Member States and four IAEA staff members.</p>
<p> The IRRS team carried out the review in the  following areas: responsibilities and functions of the government, the global  safety regime, responsibilities and functions of the regulatory body, the management  system of the regulatory body, the activities of the regulatory body including  authorization, review and assessment, inspection and enforcement, regulations  and guides. The review also included the optional module 11 on nuclear safety  and security interface. Facilities, activities and exposure situations within  the scope of the mission included all those regulated at the federal level by  CNSC: nuclear power plants, fuel cycle facilities, research reactors, waste  management facilities, decommissioning activities, transport of radioactive  material, radiation sources applications (radioactive sources and particle  accelerators), planned and existing occupational and public exposure  situations.</p>
<p> Facilities and activities with particle  accelerators below 1MV, medical exposure, and specific areas of the existing  exposure situations, regulated at provincial or territorial level were out of  the scope of the mission. In addition, and as agreed with the Canadian  counterparts responsible for the Emergency Preparedness Review (EPREV) and  those responsible for the Integrated Regulatory Review Service (IRRS), Module  10 (EPR) of the IRRS was included in the Canada EPREV and excluded from the  scope of Canada IRRS mission.</p>
<p> The IRRS mission included discussion of two  policy issues: &ldquo;Readiness for innovation from the regulator&rsquo;s perspective&rdquo;; and  &ldquo;Opportunities to strengthen the CNSC&rsquo;s regulatory safety oversight culture&rdquo;.</p>
<p> The IRRS team conducted interviews and  discussions with the staff of CNSC and representatives of HC and NRCan. Members  of the team also observed regulatory inspection activities at operating power  and research reactors, conversion facility, radioactive waste management  facilities, decommissioning activities, research centres, a University  hospital, a nuclear processing facility, a radioactive sources producer with  transportation activities also, an industrial radiography facility and an  industrial irradiator, in Ontario and Quebec. The visits also included discussions  with the authorized parties &ndash; licensees&rsquo; personnel and management.</p>
<p> In preparation for the IRRS mission, Canada  conducted a self-assessment and prepared a preliminary action plan to address  areas that were identified for improvement. The results of the self-assessment  and supporting documentation were provided to the team as advance reference  material for the mission. Throughout the mission, the IRRS team was extended  full cooperation in the regulatory, technical, and policy issues by all parties  in a very open and transparent manner.</p>
<p> The IRRS team acknowledged the outstanding  efforts of the participating authorities to engage in this extensive international  peer review. The participation by the above organisations enabled the team to  develop a broad understanding of the regulatory framework resulting in  recommendations and suggestions that should benefit nuclear and radiation  safety for all in Canada.</p>
<p> Canada has a comprehensive and robust  regulatory framework for nuclear and radiation safety covering current facilities  and activities. The CNSC strives to continuously upgrade its regulatory  framework to address new challenges and upcoming technologies,</p>
<p> The IRRS team identified the following good  practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CNSC, in partnership with  other organisations, has established a comprehensive programme for dealing with  historic radium devices in the public domain</li>
<li>The CNSC has a comprehensive  system for collecting, analysing and sharing regulatory experience feedback.</li>
<li>The CNSC is very committed to  ensuring a high level of transparency and openness with the public, stakeholders  and interested parties about its regulatory activities and decisions.</li>
<li>The CNSC proactively developed  extensive guidance and processes to assist potential applicants determine the  content of the small modular reactor application for authorization.</li>
<li>The CNSC performs peer reviews  for certification of transport packages to minimize the risk associated with  the certification of higher risk designs.</li>
<li>HC has undertaken effective  programme for raising awareness of radon through strategic and targeted messaging  to the public.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most significant challenges to Canada  relate to the enhancement of the national policy and strategy for the radioactive  waste management and the alignment of radiation protection requirements with  IAEA safety standard GSR Part 3.</p>
<p> The IRRS team made recommendations and  suggestions that indicate where improvements are necessary or desirable to  continue enhancing the effectiveness of regulatory functions in line with IAEA safety  standards. The IRRS team recognized that some of its findings also endorsed the  actions identified by Canada as a result of its self-assessment. The IRRS team  also identified some other areas for improvement including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CNSC should:
<ul>
<li>Establish public exposure dose  constraints for all Class I type facilities.</li>
<li>Align transportation regulatory  documents with IAEA SSR-6.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The IRRS team findings are summarized in  Appendix IV. </p>

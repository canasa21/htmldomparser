<h2 class="font-xxlarge">Quick facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Potassium iodide (KI) is a salt of non-radioactive iodine.</li>
<li>KI only protects the thyroid gland from radioactive iodine; it
is not effective against any other nuclear substance.</li>
<li>Do not take KI pills unless you are instructed to do so by
public health officials.</li>
<li>During a nuclear emergency, you will be promptly notified by
radio, television, Internet, sirens, automated phone calls and
social media.</li>
<li>KI saturates your thyroid gland, preventing radioactive iodine
from being absorbed; over time, the radioactive iodine will decay
and be harmlessly excreted in urine.</li>
<li>The overall benefit of taking KI during an emergency outweighs
the risk of side effects.</li>
<li>KI pills are effective for up to 12 years if they are stored in
a dry location between 15 and 30 degrees Celsius.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>What to do in the unlikely event of a nuclear emergency</h2>
<ul>
<li>Go inside and turn on your radio and/or television for
instructions</li>
<li>Listen to media reports</li>
<li>Follow instructions provided by government officials</li>
<li>Follow the proper steps for evacuation, shelter-in-place,
taking KI, and reporting to a reception centre for evaluation
and/or monitoring.</li>
</ul>
<div class="">
<h2>What is KI?</h2>
<p>Potassium iodide (KI) can be used to protect the thyroid gland
from radioactive iodine that may be released into the air in the
unlikely event of a radiological emergency. In very small
quantities, it is an essential nutrient for your thyroid gland to
function properly. In the event of a nuclear emergency, KI is
effective in reducing the threat of thyroid cancer to residents at
risk of inhaling or ingesting radioactive iodine. It comes in easy
to swallow tablet form.</p>
<p>KI only protects the thyroid gland from radioactive iodine; it
is not effective against any other nuclear substance. Depending on
the nature of the emergency, KI is a protective measure that can be
used in isolation or in combination with other protective measures
(i.e., evacuation, shelter-in-place)</p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>The thyroid gland will absorb iodine that is in a person's
bloodstream; it cannot tell the difference between radioactive
iodine and non-radioactive (stable) iodine. The absorption of
radioactive iodine can be prevented by taking KI before or soon
after its release into the air. Taking KI will saturate the thyroid
gland so that there is no space left for the radioactive iodine to
be absorbed. Over time, the radioactive iodine will undergo
radioactive decay and be harmlessly excreted in urine.</p>
<h2>When should it be taken?</h2>
<p>Not all radiological emergencies involve radioactive iodine, and
KI is only required when there are significant amounts of
radioactive iodine present. <strong>KI should only be taken when
directed by public health officials.</strong> It works best when it
is taken immediately before or as soon as possible after
exposure.</p>
<h2>Are there side effects?</h2>
<p>The risk of health side effects associated with taking KI is
very low for all age groups with regular thyroid function. For
people who have thyroid disorders (e.g., Graves' disease, iodine
deficiency/sensitivity and auto-immune thyroiditis), there is an
increased risk of side effects. People who face an increased risk
of side effects should consult a doctor or nurse prior to taking
KI. Overall, the benefit of taking the pill during a nuclear
emergency far outweighs the risk of side effects.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>KI distribution regulations in Canada</h2>
<p>In Canada, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) has
recently established a national standard for KI pill distribution.
Nuclear power plant licensees are required to ensure that KI pills
are pre-distributed to individuals living or working near a nuclear
power plant. The Province of Ontario's Office of the Fire Marshal
&amp; Emergency Management (OFMEM) and the New Brunswick Emergency
Management Organization (NBEMO) are working towards developing a
strategy to fulfill these requirements.</p>

<p>The Provincial Nuclear Emergency Response Plan (PNERP),
currently under review, assigns responsibility to each municipality
to detail in their plans their means of facilitating KI pill
availability.&nbsp; It also requires the nuclear operator, Ontario
Power Generation, Bruce Power and the Canadian Nuclear Laboratories
(except for Amherstburg), to provide resources to their
municipalities.</p>
<ul>
<li>For primary zones (within 10 km): strategy adopted is to
pre-distribute 2 doses per person per day for a maximum of 2
days.</li>

enough doses for “sensitive” populations (people aged under 19,
pregnant and breastfeeding women)</li>

<p>Since the initial start-up of the plant in 1982, KI pills have
been provided to all residences within 20 km of the station, known
as the longer-term protective zone (LPZ). This has now been
extended to schools (Fundy Shores and Pennfield elementary
schools). Residents receive an information pamphlet on KI pills
that is distributed door to door. In addition to residences, there
are several KI stockpile locations within 50 km of the nuclear
generating station.</p>

<p>There has also been a modification for the KI pill distribution
regulations at the Gentilly-2 plant in Quebec. After evaluating
radiological risk, <strong>Gentilly-2 no longer represents a risk
to surrounding populations</strong>, following decommissioning
projects that have taken place since 2013. This means that
<strong>KI pills are not a requirement</strong>. In fact,
previously eligible citizens are now encouraged to dispose of the
KI pills that they have in stock.</p>

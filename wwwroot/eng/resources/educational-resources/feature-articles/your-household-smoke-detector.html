<title>Your household smoke detectors</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Smoke detectors are the most common consumer products that use
nuclear technology to function. They are critical components of
every household and workplace because of their ability to detect
smoke in the air and identify potential fire hazards.</p>
<h2>How do they work?</h2>
<p>There are two primary technologies used in smoke detectors. One
type uses a photoelectric sensor to detect the change in light
level caused by smoke. The other uses the radiation from a small
amount of radioactive material to sense smoke. These types of
detectors, also referred to as ionization chamber smoke detectors,
are the most commonly used because of their sensitivity and ability
to identify a wider range of fire conditions.</p>

<h2>Radioactive properties</h2>
<p>Most household detectors contain a very small amount of
americium-241, a radioactive isotope. The slight amount of
radiation that can be measured outside the unit does not pose any
health risk. In fact, the average annual radiation dose from these
devices per person represents 0.01&nbsp;percent of the dose they
receive from natural background radiation. The safe encapsulation
and low amount of radioactive material make these devices
completely safe under all conditions, even during or after a
fire.</p>
<h2>Secure disposal</h2>
<p>Disposing of your household smoke detectors is safe and easy.
They can be disposed of in your regular municipal household
garbage, but not in recycling or composting waste. There is no
limit as to how many residential smoke detectors you may dispose of
at one time. Most households do not have more than one or two at
their disposal anyway. However, hiring a consultant is recommended
for the disposal of large institutional quantities or industrial
smoke detectors.</p>
<h2>Quick safety tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Batteries are used as either the sole or backup power source of
the device, depending on the brand of smoke detector. Regardless of
which kind of smoke detectors you have, it is a good idea to have
batteries in them.</li>
<li>If you hear a chirping or beeping sound, it is usually an
indication that you should replace them. To be safe, routinely test
your household devices by pressing the “test” btn to ensure their
functionality.</li>
<li>When it comes to the lifespan of the smoke detectors, different
manufacturers may have varying replacement
recommendations.&nbsp;</li>

<h2>The CNSC’s role</h2>
<p>Each smoke detector made in Canada must comply with strict
radiation safety standards before their distribution. The CNSC is
responsible for licensing the manufacturing and initial
distribution of all smoke detectors containing a radioactive source
in Canada. Check out our <a href=

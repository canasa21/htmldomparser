<title>Radiation and Incidence of Cancer Around Ontario Nuclear
Power Plants From 1990 to 2008 (The RADICON Study)</title>

<h2 id="execsummary">Executive summary</h2>
<p>The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) has completed a
groundbreaking ecological study on populations living near
Ontario's three nuclear power plants (NPPs). The purpose of the
<em>Radiation and Incidence of Cancer Around Ontario Nuclear Power
Plants from 1990 to 2008 study (the "RADICON" study)</em> was to
determine the radiation doses to members of the public living
within 25 km of the Pickering, Darlington, and Bruce NPPs and to
compare cancer cases among these people with the general population
of Ontario from 1990 to 2008. The study was conducted using data
from the Canadian and Ontario Cancer Registries and the Census of
Canada.</p>
<p>The most important finding of the RADICON study is that there is
no evidence of childhood leukemia clusters around the three Ontario
NPPs. The rates of cancer incidence for children aged 0–4 and aged
0–14 were similar to the general Ontario population.</p>
<p>Overall, for all ages, there is no consistent pattern of cancer
across the populations in question living near the three facilities
studied. Some types of cancer in the communities studied were
higher than expected (excess cancer); however, many types of cancer
were lower than expected.</p>
<p>While this type of study cannot determine the causes of the
cancer, excess cancers (increase in cancer above what's expected in
Ontario) are unlikely to be due to radiation. Radiation doses from
NPPs to members of the public are extremely low – at least 100 to
1,000&nbsp;times lower than natural background radiation and public
dose limits. As such, doses are a minor risk factor compared to the
high prevalence of major risk factors like tobacco, poor diet,
obesity and physical inactivity, which account for about 60 percent
of all cancer deaths in developed countries. These factors
represent a public health concern throughout Ontario, including the
communities located near NPPs. Other important Ontario studies
found that once these main risk factors were taken into account,
there was no evidence of a cancer risk due to environmental factors
like radiation. Given the high frequency of these factors, the
current scientific understanding of radiation risk, and the
minuscule public doses, it is not realistic to attribute any excess
cancers to the radiation doses from NPPs found in these
communities.</p>
<p>The main strength of the RADICON study is the use of detailed
public dose information around each NPP that was generated from
radiological releases and environmental monitoring data. The data
collected for this study takes into account any emission spikes
from the NPPs. This methodology improves on recent epidemiological
studies of childhood cancer that have used distance from an NPP as
a substitute for radiation dose. Doses closest to the NPPs were not
consistently higher than doses further away. Many factors influence
doses to the public as a result of the operation of an NPP,
including prevailing wind directions and lifestyle characteristics
(i.e.,&nbsp;diet and lifestyle habits) of the surrounding
communities. Therefore, distance is not a good substitute for
dose.</p>
<p>To conclude, public radiation doses resulting from the operation
of the NPPs are 100 to 1,000&nbsp;times lower than natural
background radiation and there is no evidence of childhood leukemia
clusters around the three Ontario NPPs. All cancers for all age
groups are well within the natural variation of the disease in
Ontario. Thus, radiation is not a plausible explanation for any
excess cancers observed within 25 km of any Ontario NPP.</p>

<title>Tritium in drinking water</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) wishes to reassure
members of the public that tritium levels in drinking water do not
pose a risk to their health.</p>
<p>August 20, 2009</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h2>Quick facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tritium levels measured in the drinking water of communities
near nuclear facilities do not pose a health risk.</li>
<li>Tritium levels found in the municipal drinking water of these
communities are well below national and international standards,
and below the 20 Bq/L limit proposed by the Ontario Drinking Water
Advisory Council (ODWAC).</li>
<li>Tritium releases from nuclear facilities only contribute a
small amount to the overall exposure of Canadians to radiation.
Background radiation and radiation from medical procedures
represent the most significant sources of radioactive exposure for
the public.</li>
<li>Tritium levels are monitored continuously by provincial
authorities, municipalities, nuclear power plant and tritium
processing facility operators and AECL's Chalk River facility to
ensure the protection of the public and the environment.</li>
<li>The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) sets limits on
releases from nuclear facilities into the environment and tracks
these releases to ensure the protection of the public and the
environment.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Media reports have recently highlighted the concerns of several
citizens and groups about tritium levels in drinking water. The
CNSC wants to reassure the public that the levels of tritium
contained in the drinking water of communities near nuclear
facilities do not pose a risk to their health.</p>

<p>On June 9, 2009, the ODWAC released its <a href=
"http://www.odwac.gov.on.ca/reports/minister%20reports/052109_ODWAC_Tritium_Report.pdf">
Report and Advice on the Ontario Drinking Water Quality Standard
for Tritium</a>. ODWAC recommends that the Ontario Ministry of
Environment lowers its limits from 7,000 Bq/L to 20 Bq/L.</p>
<p>Currently, the measured tritium levels in the municipal drinking
water of the communities near nuclear facilities are well below all
enforceable national and international standards, and below the
ODWAC's proposed limits.</p>
<h2>What is tritium?</h2>
<p>Tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen. It emits very
low-energy beta radiation, which is blocked by common materials
such as sheets of plastic, glass or metal, and cannot penetrate the
top layer of human skin. Tritium may be absorbed into the body
through the skin or when ingested through water or food, or when
inhaled.</p>
<p>Tritium is a naturally occurring radioactive substance, which is
formed in the upper atmosphere due to the continuous bombardment of
atmospheric gases by high energy cosmic rays. In Canada, natural
tritium levels vary between 0.2 and 1.4 Bq/L, depending on
geographical location and other factors.</p>
<p>Tritium is also present in the environment as a result of
atmospheric nuclear weapons testing in the 1950s and 1960s. Since
then, these concentrations have steadily declined and are now
ranging from 2 to 3 Bq/L across Canada.</p>
<p>Nuclear reactors and tritium processing facilities are also
sources of controlled releases of tritium.</p>
<h2>How is tritium in drinking water measured?</h2>
<p>The amount of tritium in water is measured in becquerels per
litre (Bq/L). The effect of the radioactivity on the body is
calculated in millisieverts (mSv).</p>
<p>A becquerel is a unit for measuring radioactive decay or
radioactivity. It is a standard unit used internationally to
measure radioactivity in nuclear substances, including tritium.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p><strong>Amount of tritium in water is measured in
Bq/L</strong></p>
<p>The unit (Bq/L) measures the radioactivity associated with
tritium in the water.</p>
<p><strong>Effect of tritium on the body is measured in
mSv</strong></p>
<p>The unit (mSv) measures the effect of the radioactivity on the
whole body.</p>
</div>
<p>Every radioactive substance has a different effect on the human
body. The radiation dose tells us the effect the radiation has on
the body.</p>
<p>The standard unit to calculate the radiation dose is the sievert
(Sv). However, the Sv is a large unit, so the regulators and the
industry use the millisievert (mSv), which is equivalent to 0.001
Sv.</p>
<p>The radiation dose is used by the CNSC to set the safety level
limits for the public.</p>
<p>In order to calculate the annual dose from tritium in drinking
water, one must take into account:</p>
<ul>
<li>the tritium concentration in the water (in Bq/L)</li>
<li>an individual's average daily water consumption (assumed)</li>
</ul>
<p>For an adult, assuming a daily consumption of two litres of
water, each Bq/L corresponds to a dose of 0.000015 mSv
annually.</p>
<p>For an infant, assuming a daily consumption of one litre of
water, each Bq/L corresponds to a dose of 0.000021 mSv
annually.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>The maximum average annual tritium levels, as measured in the
municipal drinking water of Canadian communities neighbouring
nuclear facilities, are about 18 Bq/l.</p>
<p>If an adult drank two litres of water a day with 18 Bq/L of
tritium<br />
for an entire year, that person would receive a dose of 0.00027 mSv
per year<br />
[18 x 0.000015 mSv = 0.00027 mSv].</p>
<p>If an infant drank one litre of water a day with 18 Bq/L of
tritium<br />
for an entire year, that infant would receive a dose of 0.00038 mSv
per year<br />
[18 x 0.000021 mSv = 0.00038 mSv].</p>
</div>
<h2>What does it mean?</h2>
<p>The amounts calculated in the example above (0.00027 mSv and
0.00038 mSv) represent only small fractions of the regulatory limit
of 1 mSv. The low doses are attributable to the implementation of
CNSC requirements to keep doses as low as reasonably achievable
(ALARA).</p>
<p>Studies have shown that the minimum chronic dose causing
negative health effects is 100 mSv. The regulatory limit of 1 mSv
is, therefore, equivalent to 1 percent of this amount.</p>
<p>To put this amount (1 mSv) in context, let's look at the
different sources of radiation to which typical Canadians are
exposed to: background radiation and radiation from medical
procedures (like X-rays and CT scans).</p>
<p>The annual dose linked to background radiation in Canada is
about <a href=
"http://rpd.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/108/3/215">1.8 mSv</a>.
It is worth noting that background levels vary across the country,
depending on altitude and radon concentrations. For example, the
annual background radiation dose for someone living in Toronto has
been estimated at 1.6 mSv per year, but a similar estimate for
Winnipeg was 4.0 mSv per year, due to the higher radon
concentrations in homes.</p>
<p>Background radiation is mainly due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>naturally occurring radioactive minerals like uranium and
thorium, including radon gas (a product of the natural decay of
uranium)</li>
<li>cosmic radiation</li>
<li>fallout from the nuclear weapons testing in the 1950s and 1960s
(in steady decrease)</li>
<li>other naturally-occurring and man-made radioisotopes</li>
</ul>
<p>Medical procedures account for about 1.2 mSv on average. It is
also worth noting that this figure varies from person to person,
depending on the number of radiological diagnosis and
treatments.</p>
<p>The 0.00027 mSv dose, as related to the consumption of drinking
water containing 18 Bq/L (seen in our example above) is
insignificant compared to the dose from background radiation and
medical procedures.</p>
<p>The figure below illustrates the radiation dose related to
different sources.</p>

<h2>How are tritium levels in drinking water regulated and
monitored?</h2>
<h3>Drinking water quality</h3>
<p>Canadian provinces have control over the regulations for the
quality of the drinking water, including setting limits for tritium
levels.</p>
<p>Provincial authorities and municipalities have monitoring
programs to control water quality, including tritium levels.</p>
<p>Nuclear power plant operators, as well as AECL's facility in
Chalk River, have monitoring programs in place to sample and report
tritium concentrations in drinking water.</p>
<p>Other nuclear facilities, such as tritium processing facilities,
have their own environmental monitoring programs to keep tritium
levels under control.</p>
<p>Health Canada recommends 7,000 Bq/L as the maximum amount of
tritium in drinking water. Some provinces, such as Ontario, have
adopted this value as a legal standard.</p>
<p>Health Canada's guideline is based on the recommendations of the
International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and the
World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
<p>On June 9, 2009, the ODWAC proposed to the Ontario Ministry of
Environment to lower the enforceable limit of tritium in drinking
water from 7,000 Bq/L to 20 Bq/L.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that tritium levels in the municipal drinking
water of the communities near nuclear facilities in Canada are well
below national and international standards, and below the new 20
Bq/L limit proposed by the ODWAC.</p>
<p>Tritium levels in the municipal drinking water of these
communities vary between 6.4 and 18 Bq/L, and therefore do not
result in any significant exposure of the public to radiation.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p><strong>The ALARA principle</strong></p>
<p>Refers to the requirement to keep exposures "as low as
reasonably achievable"</p>
<p><strong>How much tritium is a Terabecquerel (TBq)?</strong></p>
<p>A terabecquerel (TBq) represents one million, million
(10<sup>12</sup>) becquerels (Bq). A Bq is a measure of the amount
of radioactivity but has little to do with the weight or volume of
the material.</p>
<p>For example, a Bq of tritium has the same activity as a Bq of
uranium. However, the weight of one Bq of tritium is about
1/10,000,000,000th of a Bq of uranium-238. This is because tritium
has a much shorter half-life than uranium (12.3 years compared to
4.5 billion years).</p>
<p>A Bq of tritium weighs 2.8 X 10<sup>-15</sup> grams, or 2.8
femtograms (fg) and a TBq of pure tritium would weigh 0.003 grams.
Of course, one never gets pure tritium. Tritium's most common form
is HTO, or tritiated water. So a TBq of tritiated water would weigh
about 0.02 grams.</p>
</div>
<h3>Releases to the environment</h3>
<p>The CNSC requires nuclear facility operators to closely monitor
and report tritium releases into the environment. The releases of
tritium into the environment are controlled, and do not pose a
health risk.</p>
<p>The CNSC sets the limit for the radiation dose for the public
arising from the activities of nuclear facilities at 1&nbsp;mSv per
year. In addition, to minimize the environmental impact of tritium
releases, the CNSC uses the ALARA principle, which means that
licensees are required to keep exposures "as low as reasonably
achievable".</p>
<p>All authorized releases to the environment - known as derived
release limits (DRLs) - are calculated using a methodology that
considers the various ways in which radionuclides, such as tritium,
can impact members of the public.</p>
<p>For instance, the methodology must take into account the impact
of tritium releases on locally-grown food, water supply and air
quality. The methodology used is conservative and assumes, for
instance, that individuals live, work and stay in their community
for extended periods of time.</p>
<p>DRLs are specific to each facility and take into account various
regional factors such as meteorological and geographical conditions
as well as the population density near the facility.</p>
<p>As an example, Ontario Power Generation's Pickering B nuclear
power plant has a DRL of about 490,000 Terabecquerels (or 4.9 X
10<sup>17</sup> Bq) for tritium liquid emissions. However, with the
implementation of controls based on ALARA their actual annual
release in 2008 was about 200 TBq, about 0.04 percent of the
DRL.</p>
<p>Action levels (ALs) are set as a condition of the licence and
licensees must report any release above these levels to the CNSC.
ALs represent a small fraction of the DRLs (0.05 percent) and are
rarely reached during the year.</p>
<p>The CNSC's approach to regulating tritium releases into the
environment has provided strong protection for the quality of the
drinking water of the communities near nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>As an example, Figure 2, below, presents levels of tritium in
four drinking water supply plants on the Ottawa River downstream of
AECL's Chalk River Laboratories.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>The EU does not use this number as a limit, but
rather as a screening value to indicate the possible presence of
other artifical radionuclides.</p>
</figure>
<p>In other countries, the enforceable drinking water standards for
tritium vary between 740 Bq/L (US) and 76,103 Bq/L (Australia).</p>
<p>In the European Union (EU), requirements for radioactivity in
drinking water are not mandatory but only used as indicators to
trigger further investigation. The EU tritium indicator value of
100 Bq/L is used as a screening value, automatically triggering an
investigation if reached.</p>
<p>In 2006, California adopted a non-mandatory public health goal
of 14.8&nbsp;Bq/l for tritium in drinking water.</p>
<p>The observed concentrations of tritium in the drinking water in
Canada are below and slightly above California's non-mandatory
health goal and below the limit of 20 Bq/L recommended by the
ODWAC.</p>
<p>Considering the very low concentrations of tritium in drinking
water in Canada, the CNSC concludes that health risks to the
population are insignificant.</p>
<p>The CNSC tracks tritium levels continuously to ensure the
protection of the public and the environment. The organisation is
committed to protecting the health of Canadians and will continue
to do so by drawing on the best domestic and international
practices.</p>

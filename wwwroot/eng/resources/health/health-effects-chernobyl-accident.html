<title>Health Effects of the Chernobyl Accident</title>
</head>
<body>
<p><strong>August 2018</strong></p>
<h2>Quick facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>The 1986 accident at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine was
the largest uncontrolled radioactive release in history.</li>
<li>The initial steam explosion resulted in the deaths of two
workers. 134 plant staff and emergency workers suffered acute
radiation syndrome (ARS) due to high doses of radiation; of those,
28 of them later died from ARS.</li>
<li>The total number of cases of thyroid cancer registered in the
1991–2015 period among those under 18 years of age in 1986 (for the
whole of Belarus and Ukraine, and for the four most-contaminated
oblasts of the Russian Federation), approached 20,000.
<ul>
<li>About 5,000 thyroid cancer cases were attributable to
radioactive iodine (iodine-131) exposure to those who were children
or adolescents at the time of the accident.</li>
<li>The remaining 15,000 cases are due to a variety of factors,
such as increased spontaneous incidence rate with aging of the
population, awareness of thyroid cancer risk after the accident,
and improved diagnostic methods to detect thyroid cancer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There were no other demonstrated increases in the rates of
solid cancers, leukemia and non-cancerous diseases from the
radiation exposure.</li>
<li>In the three most-affected countries – Belarus, the Russian
Federation and Ukraine – radiation doses to the general public were
relatively low.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 1986 accident at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine was
the largest uncontrolled radioactive release in history.</p>
<p>On April 26, 1986, steam and hydrogen explosions at the
Chernobyl plant's Unit 4 led to a rupture in the reactor vessel and
a fire that lasted 10 days. The explosions and fire caused the
release of large amounts of radioactive iodine and cesium into the
air, mostly near the plant; the wind carried some material over
Belarus, the Russian Federation, Ukraine and other parts of
Europe.</p>
<p>The following summarizes the health assessments published in the
United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic
Radiation (UNSCEAR) 2008 Report titled <a href=
"http://www.unscear.org/unscear/en/chernobyl.html"><em>Health
effects due to radiation from the Chernobyl accident</em></a> and
the UNSCEAR 2018 White Paper titled <a href=
"http://www.unscear.org/unscear/en/publications.html"><em>Evaluation
of data on thyroid cancer in regions affected by the Chernobyl
accident</em></a>. The findings in these reports are based on
approximately 30 years of studies of the health consequences of
radiation exposure from the Chernobyl accident. UNSCEAR
acknowledges that thyroid cancer after the Chernobyl accident is a
major issue and that further investigation is needed to determine
the long-term consequences.</p>

<h2>Radiation released during the Chernobyl accident</h2>
<p>Workers and the public were exposed to three main types of
radionuclides: iodine-131, cesium-134 and cesium-137.</p>
<p>When iodine-131 is released into the environment, it is quickly
transferred to humans and taken up by the thyroid gland. However,
I-131 has a short half-life (8 days). Children exposed to
radioactive iodine usually receive higher doses than adults,
because their thyroid gland is smaller and they have a higher
metabolism.</p>
<p>Cesium isotopes have longer half-lives (approximately 2 years
for cesium-134 and 30 years for cesium-137), increasing the chance
of long-term exposure through ingestion of contaminated food and
water, inhalation of contaminated air, or from radionuclides
deposited in soil.</p>
<h3>Worker health impacts</h3>
<p>On the day of the accident, there were 600 workers onsite. 134
suffered acute radiation sickness, 28 of whom died in the first
three months. For those who survived radiation sickness, recovery
took several years.</p>
<p>Among the 600 workers onsite, increased incidences of leukemia
and cataracts were recorded for those exposed to higher doses of
radiation; otherwise, there has been no increase in the incidence
of solid cancers or leukemia among the rest of the exposed workers.
There is no evidence of increases in other non-cancerous diseases
from ionizing radiation.</p>
<p>The 530,000 registered recovery operation workers who worked at
the accident site between 1986 and 1990 were exposed to doses
ranging from 20 to 500 mSv (averaging 120 mSv). This cohort's
health is still being closely followed.</p>

<h3>Public health impacts</h3>
<p>The 115,000 members of the public who had to be evacuated from
the area around the plant received an average effective radiation
dose of 30 mSv. Radiation doses to the general public in the three
contaminated countries (Belarus, the Russian Federation and
Ukraine) were relatively low, with an average effective dose of 9
mSv, about the dose of a medical CT scan (i.e., 10 mSv). The total
worldwide average effective dose from natural background radiation
is around 2.4 mSv per year. In Canada, it is 1.8 mSv per year.</p>
<p>Among the residents of Belarus, the Russian Federation and
Ukraine, as of 2015 there had been almost 20,000 cases of thyroid
cancer reported in children and adolescents who were exposed at the
time of the accident. Approximately 5,000 of these thyroid cancers
are likely attributable to children drinking fresh milk containing
radioactive iodine from cows who had eaten contaminated grass in
the first few weeks following the accident. The remaining 15,000
cases are due to a variety of factors, such as increased
spontaneous incidence rate with aging of the population, awareness
of thyroid cancer risk after the accident, and improved diagnostic
methods to detect thyroid cancer.</p>
<p>The radiation dose due to Chernobyl in other European countries
was less than 1 mSv. In more distant countries, radiation from the
accident had no impact on the annual background doses and was
considered to be non-significant to public health.</p>

</div>
<h3>Psychological or mental health problems</h3>
<p>According to several international studies, people exposed to
radiation from Chernobyl have high anxiety levels and are more
likely to report unexplained physical symptoms and poor health.</p>
<h3>Concerns about fertility and birth defects</h3>
<p>There is no evidence of decreased fertility in men or women in
the affected regions. Because doses to the general population were
low, it is unlikely that there would be any increase in
stillbirths, adverse pregnancy outcomes, delivery complications, or
negative impacts on children's overall health. Regardless,
monitoring remains important and is ongoing.</p>

<p>The UNSCEAR 2008 report on Chernobyl confirmed that, while new
research data has become available, the major conclusions about the
1986 Chernobyl accident's health consequences are essentially
consistent with previous assessments. The UNSCEAR 2018 White Paper
acknowledges that thyroid cancer is the major health issue (in
individuals who were children or adolescents at the time of the
accident) and that further investigation is needed to determine the
long-term consequences of radiation exposure. The previous fear of
an increase in leukemia rates has not materialized, nor have any
fertility problems arisen. As previous assessments indicate,
psychological effects – such as high anxiety – and general poor
health were observed. Previous studies have shown that there were
no global consequences of the accident in Asia and North America,
which remains true today.</p>

<p>On October 12, 1946, the Atomic Energy Control Act was
proclaimed. Under the act, the Government of Canada established the
Atomic Energy Control Board (AECB) as a regulatory agency to
provide for "control and supervision of the development,
application and use of atomic energy and to enable Canada to
participate effectively in measures of international control of
atomic energy."</p>
<p>On May 31, 2000, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC)
was formed under the new Nuclear Safety and Control Act. The CNSC
replaced the AECB, which had been Canada's nuclear regulator for
more than 50 years. The new legislation provided the CNSC with a
stronger, more modern legislative basis to carry out its various
responsibilities. The act sets out the CNSC's mandate,
responsibilities and powers. It provides the CNSC with the
authority to regulate the development, production and use of
nuclear energy and the production, possession and use of nuclear
substances, prescribed equipment and prescribed information in
Canada.</p>
<p>Canada has a rich history of nuclear safety. Nuclear safety
means protecting health and the environment at every stage in the
nuclear fuel cycle – from uranium mining to power generation,
nuclear research, nuclear facilities and prescribed equipment,
industrial and medical applications of nuclear materials and waste
disposal. We also monitor for environmental impacts from nuclear
activities, and fulfill Canada’s international commitments on
non-proliferation.</p>

regulation history. Each article explores a decade in the evolution
of Canada’s nuclear regulating body and highlights the important
events of the time.</p>

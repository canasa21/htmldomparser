<h4><a id="F1"></a>Overview</h4>
<p>Canada is one of the major producers of nuclear substances
(radioactive material) in the world and has an excellent safety
record for the transport of radioactive material. More than a
million packages containing radioactive material are transported
safely in Canada each year. The responsibility for ensuring safe
transport of nuclear substances is jointly shared between the CNSC
and Transport Canada.</p>
<p>Transport Canada's <em>Transportation of Dangerous Goods</em>
(tdG) <em>Regulations</em> deal with the transport of all classes
of dangerous goods, while the CNSC's <em>Packaging and Transport of
Nuclear Substances</em> (PTNS) <em>Regulations</em> are primarily
concerned with health, safety and security of the public, and
protection of the environment related to the special
characteristics of radioactive material. Both the tdG and PTNS
regulations apply to all persons who handle, offer for transport,
transport or receive nuclear substances.</p>
<p class="text-right"><a href="#wb-main">Top of page</a></p>
<h4><a id="F2"></a>Regulating the packaging and transport of
nuclear substances</h4>
<p>All industrialized countries use the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) TS-R-1, <em>Regulations for the Safe Transport of
Radioactive Material</em> as the basis to regulate the packaging
and transport of radioactive material. Through the PTNS
Regulations, the CNSC regulates all aspects of the packaging of
radioactive material, including the design, production, use,
inspection, maintenance and repair of packages. The CNSC also
regulates all phases of transport from the preparation of packages
for shipment until unloading at the final destination.</p>
<p>There are exemptions currently in place under the PTNS
Regulations, which include persons who have undergone medical
treatments, certain consumer products once sold to consumers (e.g.,
smoke detectors), and radioactive material that is a component of a
transport vehicle (such as depleted uranium counterweights used in
aircrafts).</p>
<p class="text-right"><a href="#wb-main">Top of page</a></p>
<h4><a id="F3"></a>Safety of transport package design</h4>
<p>The basic philosophy that has guided the development of the CNSC
Regulations is that safety relies heavily on the design of the
transport package. Package designs are combined with additional
regulatory controls including labeling, placarding, quality
assurance and maintenance records, and allow for radioactive
material to be carried safely in all modes of transport such as
road, rail, air and sea transportation.</p>
<p>All nuclear substances are transported in packages that are
selected based on the nature, form and quantity or activity of the
substance. There are general design requirements that apply to all
package types to ensure that they can be handled safely and easily,
secured properly, and are able to withstand routine conditions of
transport.</p>
<h4>Non-certified packages</h4>

</div>
</div>
<p>Packages designed for the transport of low risk levels of
radioactive material do not require certification by the CNSC due
to their low level of risk. These packages carry quantities that
will have little or no impact on the health and safety of
Canadians. The responsibility for meeting the regulations rests
with the consignor, who must be able to provide written
demonstration that the package meets the regulatory performance
standards. Substances transported in these types of packages can
include surface contaminated objects, portable gauges, returned
empty packages, and radioactive medical isotopes.</p>
<h4>Certified packages</h4>

<div class="image-caption">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Packages designed for the transport of high risk levels of
radioactive material require certification by the CNSC before they
can be used in Canada. Persons must register their use of the
package with the CNSC and acknowledge that they have the necessary
training to properly prepare it for shipment. These packages are
required to undergo stringent testing since improper handling of
their contents can give rise to severe consequences. Testing must
simulate both normal and hypothetical conditions of transport and
can include free-drop testing, puncture testing, thermal testing
and simulated aircraft accidents. These packages are designed to
transport material such as Cobalt-60, sources used for industrial
radiography, used nuclear fuel and enriched uranium.</p>
<p class="text-right"><a href="#wb-main">Top of page</a></p>
<h4><a id="F4"></a>Certification process for transport
packages</h4>
<p>For packages that require certification, CNSC specialists carry
out the technical review of the information and test results
submitted by the applicant to ensure that the package design meets
all regulatory requirements. The regulations require that a
demonstration of compliance be done by conducting actual tests on
prototypes or scale test models, by engineering calculations and
reasoned arguments using national or international industry
standards, or through reference to similar, previously certified
designs.</p>
<p>An application for package certification typically contains
information on:</p>
<ul>
<li>structural design</li>
<li>thermal and shielding evaluation</li>
<li>containment of the nuclear substance in the package</li>
<li>the operation of the package</li>
<li>the maintenance program</li>
<li>the quality assurance program followed for the design, the
manufacture and maintenance of the package</li>
</ul>
<p>For packages approved in other countries, a Canadian
re-validation is required prior to their use in Canada. This
process ensures that the package design meets all of the
requirements of the Canadian regulations.</p>
<p>The PTNS Regulations are based on the IAEA Regulations which
provide standards for ensuring a high level of safety of people,
property and the environment against radiation and other hazards
associated with the transport of nuclear substances. The approval
requirements are relative to the hazards posed by the nuclear
substance being transported. The design requirements for packages
requiring CNSC approval ensure that in the event of a severe
accident, there is a very low level of probability of significant
radioactive release.</p>
<p>Based on the recommendations of CNSC specialists, certificates
are issued by the Commission or by designated officers who have
been designated by the Commission.</p>
<p class="text-right"><a href="#wb-main">Top of page</a></p>
<h4><a id="F5"></a>Licensing requirements for the packaging and
transport of nuclear substances</h4>
<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Did you know?</strong>
<p>A transportation security plan requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>a full description of the nuclear material</li>
<li>a threat assessment to identify any credible threats</li>
<li>a description of the type of vehicle used to transport</li>
<li>the proposed security measures in place during transport, such
as continuous tracking and type of escort</li>
<li>the communications arrangement between the carrier and the
response force (e.g., Canadian police agencies)</li>
<li>the communication arrangement between the licensee and the
response force</li>
<li>the primary and alternate transportation routes</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Transport activities are generally exempt from licensing by the
CNSC provided the package meets regulatory requirements. However,
under the regulations, there are three specific circumstances for
which a transport licence is required:</p>
<ul>
<li>transits of high risk levels of nuclear substances where there
is no Canadian licensee involved in the shipment either at origin
or destination</li>
<li>special arrangement shipments where there are measures in place
to ensure the safety of the shipment (e.g., material that is not
able to be placed in a regulated package type)</li>
<li>transport of plutonium and enriched uranium above the
quantities specified in the <em>Nuclear Security Regulations</em>.
In order to transport these shipments, a transportation security
plan must be in place and approved by the CNSC. The primary purpose
of this plan is to assure that the nuclear material to be
transported will receive adequate physical protection against any
threats that may arise during its transport</li>
</ul>
<p>There are approximately 150 transport licences issued every year
in Canada. Most of these licences are issued for specific
shipments, and are only valid for a limited period of time (three
months on average). Transport licences can be issued either by the
Commission or by designated officers who have been designated by
the Commission.</p>
<p class="text-right"><a href="#wb-main">Top of page</a></p>
<h4><a id="F6"></a>Preparing packages for transport</h4>
<p>In preparing a package for shipment, the consignor is
responsible for ensuring that the package meets all of the
requirements specified in the regulations.</p>
<p>Packages are to be categorized and labeled based on the
radiation level at both the surface and at one metre from the
package (this is referred to as the transport index (TI)). The TI
is used to limit the number of packages onboard a transport vehicle
and to segregate packages from persons or other goods.</p>
<p>The consignor is also responsible for preparing the transport
document, which contains a description of the package being
transported, the shipping name of the dangerous good, the United
Nations number, the form of the material, the isotope, the maximum
activity, the category of package, the transport index and the
applicable identification mark for each approval certificate.</p>
<p>The person receiving a shipment of radioactive material is
usually a CNSC licensee. In accordance with the PTNS Regulations,
that person must verify that the package is not damaged and has not
been tampered with.</p>
<p class="text-right"><a href="#wb-main">Top of page</a></p>
<h4><a id="F7"></a>Emergency preparedness</h4>
<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Did you know?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Current regulations don't allow the public disclosure of
security information on the location, routes and timing of
shipments, nor any security arrangements or procedures specific to
the transport of certain types of packages. This type of
information is considered prescribed, and is limited to persons who
have a legitimate need to know, such as police response
forces.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Under the PTNS and the tdG Regulations, the shipper must have
measures in place to respond in the event of an emergency involving
the transport of their radioactive material. In addition, the tdG
Regulations require the shipper to display a 24-hour emergency
telephone number on the shipping document that accompanies a
shipment of dangerous goods. The purpose of these requirements is
to ensure that appropriate technical assistance is immediately
available to initial emergency responders.</p>
<p>The PTNS Regulations require that all incidents be immediately
reported to the CNSC. Once notified of a transport incident
involving radioactive material, CNSC transport staff will follow up
to provide appropriate technical information and advice to
responders onsite. CNSC staff can be deployed immediately, if
needed, to assist in managing the incident.</p>
<p class="text-right"><a href="#wb-main">Top of page</a></p>
<h4><a id="F8"></a>Compliance with CNSC regulations</h4>
<p>CNSC inspectors do regular compliance verifications to ensure
that licensees and carriers comply with the PTNS Regulations. They
verify proof of training for transport workers, review transport
documents and inspect packages to ensure they are prepared for
transport in accordance with regulations. If a licensee or carrier
is found to be non-compliant with these regulations, the CNSC uses
a graded enforcement approach for the implementation of corrective
measures. The CNSC remains committed to ensuring the health, safety
and security of the environment and the Canadian public.</p>

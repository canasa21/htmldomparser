<title>Facts about tritium</title>

<body>
<h2>What is tritium?</h2>
<p>Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. It has the same
number of protons and electrons as hydrogen but has 2 neutrons,
whereas regular hydrogen does not have any. This makes tritium
unstable and radioactive. Tritium is produced naturally from
interactions of cosmic rays with gases in the upper atmosphere, and
is also a by-product of nuclear reactors.</p>
<p>Like all radioactive isotopes, tritium decays. As it decays, it
emits beta radiation.</p>
<p>The physical half-life of tritium is 12.33 years, meaning that
it takes just over 12 years for tritium to decay to half of its
original amount. As tritium decays, it changes to helium.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>Tritium can be combined with phosphor to create glow-in-the-dark
lighting such as exit signs, emergency lighting in buildings, and
airport runway lights.</p>
<p>It is also used as a tracer in biomedical research to study and
diagnose heart disease, cancer and AIDS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the future, it may also be used to generate electricity in
fusion reactors.</p>
<p>Where does tritium go?</p>
<p>Small amounts of tritium are released to the environment, mostly
from reactor operation and maintenance and during the manufacture
of tritium light sources.</p>
<h2>In water</h2>
<p>The most common form of tritium is tritiated water, which is
formed when a tritium atom replaces a hydrogen atom in water
(H<sub>2</sub>O) to form HTO.</p>
<p>HTO has the same chemical properties as water and is odourless
and colourless.</p>
<p>Tritiated water has a biological half-life of 10 days, but in
the body, a small amount binds to proteins, fat and carbohydrates
with an average 40-day half-life.</p>
<h2>In food</h2>
<p>Some of the tritium released into the environment can get into
nutrients such as carbohydrates, fats or proteins. Tritium consumed
in food (organically bound tritium) poses a slightly greater health
risk, as the body retains it longer than tritiated water. This
means the tritium atom is more likely to decay while in the body,
possibly damaging cells. The body can repair this type of damage on
its own.</p>
<h2>Health effects</h2>
<p>Tritium is a relatively weak source of beta radiation, which
itself is too weak to penetrate the skin. However, it can increase
the risk of cancer if consumed in extremely large quantities.</p>
<p>Tritium can enter the body through inhalation, ingestion or
absorption through the skin. Most tritium leaves the body as
tritiated water in urine, in breath as moisture and through
perspiration. Most inhaled tritiated hydrogen gas is exhaled
immediately.</p>
<h2>Protecting you</h2>
<p>The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) sets limits on the
releases of tritium and requires all Canadian nuclear operators to
conduct and report on their environmental monitoring.</p>
<p>The highest average annual tritium level measured in the
drinking water of Canadian communities near nuclear facilities is
about 18 becquerels per litre (Bq/L), well below Health Canadaâ€™s
recommended drinking water limit of 7,000 Bq/L.</p>

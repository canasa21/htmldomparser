Sheet – Understanding Radiation</a> (PDF, 2 pages, 522 KB)</p>
<p>Simply put, radiation is energy in the form of moving waves or
streams of particles. This energy can be high-frequency, like
X-rays or cosmic rays from outer space or low-frequency, like
microwaves and radio waves. This range of energy makes up the
electromagnetic spectrum and is divided into two main types of
radiation: ionizing and non-ionizing.</p>
<p>Non-ionizing radiation does not possess enough energy to create
charged atoms or molecules, called ions. Ionizing radiation, on the
other hand, does possess sufficient energy to create ions. Ions can
be harmful to your body, but they can also be used for many
beneficial purposes.</p>

<h2>Quick facts</h2>
<p><strong>Ionizing radiation</strong> is higher-energy radiation
that is capable of removing electrons from atoms as it passes
through matter (such as air, water or living tissue). Examples
include alpha particles, gamma rays, X-rays and neutrons.</p>
<p><strong>Non-ionizing radiation</strong> is radiation of lower
energy than ionizing radiation; it does not possess enough energy
to produce ions. Examples include visible light, infrared, and
radio waves.</p>

<p>The electromagnetic spectrum is the range of frequencies of
electromagnetic radiation. It is divided into two main types of
radiation: ionizing and non-ionizing. Ionizing radiation is higher
frequency with shorter wavelengths. Examples of ionizing radiation
include cosmic rays, gamma rays and x-rays. Non-ionizing radiation
is lower frequency and longer wavelengths. Examples of non-ionizing
radiation include visible light, infrared and radio waves.</p>

<h2>Sources of radiation</h2>
<p>We live on a planet where we are exposed to natural background
radiation. Radioactive materials are present in soil, rocks, the
air we breathe, the water we drink, and even in our own bodies.
These sources of natural radiation make up the bulk of the total
radiation we are exposed to every day. We are also exposed to
artificial radiation from various sources, such as nuclear medicine
– which uses radioactive material to diagnose and treat cancer, the
nuclear fuel cycle, as well as commercial products like smoke
detectors.</p>
<h2>Putting radiation doses into perspective</h2>
<p>The health effects of radiation are well understood. Since the
early 20th century, radiation’s effects have been studied in depth,
in both the laboratory and among human populations. Because of the
known health risks of radiation, it must be carefully used and
strictly controlled. A balance must be struck between radiation’s
societal benefits and the risks that radiation poses to people and
the environment.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, a dose is the quantity we use when we talk
about the potential health effects of radiation. An effective dose
takes into account the type of radiation you’ve been exposed to and
the organs in your body which have been exposed. It is expressed
using the unit "sievert" or more commonly "millisievert" (mSv),
which is 1,000 times smaller.</p>
<p>The CNSC sets radiation dose limits for nuclear energy workers
and the public in Canada in order to keep radiation doses well
below harmful levels to protect human health and safety.</p>

operating nuclear power plant in Canada for one year.</p>

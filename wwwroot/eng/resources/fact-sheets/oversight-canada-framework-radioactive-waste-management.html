<title>Oversight of Canada's Framework for Radioactive Waste
Management</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>April 2018</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h3>Quick Facts</h3>
<ul>
<li>The three Rs apply to the management of radioactive
<strong>waste: reduce, reuse</strong> and
<strong>recycle</strong>.</li>
<li>The CNSC supports the principle of good waste management
practices in the nuclear industry to reduce the volume of
radioactive waste requiring storage.</li>
<li>The CNSC's policy on managing radioactive waste requires that
waste owners put in place design measures, operating procedures and
decommissioning practices to minimize radioactive waste.</li>
<li>The Government of Canada and the nuclear industry are
developing solutions for long-term radioactive waste management
that protects the health, safety and security of persons and the
environment.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>What is radioactive waste?</h2>
<p>Radioactive waste is defined as any material (liquid, gaseous or
solid) that contains a radioactive nuclear substance for which the
owner has no foreseen use and which is determined to be a waste
product. In Canada, nuclear facilities produce a range of
radioactive waste, such as uranium mine waste and mill tailings,
medical isotope waste, used nuclear fuel, decommissioning waste,
industrial waste and cleaning material contaminated with low levels
of nuclear substances. All the radioactive waste in Canada,
including used nuclear fuel, is currently held in safe, secure and
environmentally sound interim storage facilities.</p>
<p>In all licensed activities in Canada, the waste producers are
required to manage the waste in a safe and secure manner and to
make arrangements for the long-term management of the waste.</p>
<h2>Policy framework for radioactive waste management</h2>
<p>The Government of Canada's <a href=
"http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/uranium-nuclear/7725">Radioactive
Waste Policy Framework</a> sets the stage for institutional and
financial arrangements to manage radioactive waste in a safe,
comprehensive, environmentally sound, integrated and cost-effective
manner. The Framework recognizes that long-term management
arrangements may be different for various categories of radioactive
wastes, such as used nuclear fuel, low- and intermediate-level
radioactive waste, and uranium mining and milling waste. The
framework specifies that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Government of Canada is responsible for developing policy
and for regulating and overseeing radioactive waste producers and
owners to ensure that they comply with legal requirements and they
meet their funding and operational responsibilities in accordance
with approved long-term waste management plans</li>
<li>in accordance with the "polluter pays" principle, waste owners
are responsible for the funding, organization, management and
operation of the facilities required to safely manage their wastes
over the short and long terms</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2002, Parliament passed the <a href=
"http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-27.7/"><em>Nuclear Fuel
Waste Act</em></a> (NFWA), making the owners of used fuel
responsible for the development of long-term waste management
approaches. The legislation required nuclear energy corporations to
establish a waste management organization as a separate legal
entity to manage the full range of long-term used fuel management
activities. It also required the organization to prepare and submit
a study to the Government of Canada on proposed approaches for the
long-term management of the waste. Under the NFWA, the Government
of Canada is responsible for reviewing the study prepared by the
waste management organization, selecting a long-term management
option from those proposed and ensuring oversight during its
implementation. In accordance with the NFWA, the <a href=
"https://www.nwmo.ca/en">Nuclear Waste Management Organization</a>
(NWMO) was established in 2002 by Canada's nuclear electricity
producers. The NWMO assumed responsibility for designing and
implementing Canada's plan for the safe, long-term management of
used nuclear fuel through deep geological repositories, among other
solutions. After a comprehensive three-year study and public
engagement, the Government of Canada selected the NWMO's <a href=
"http://www.nwmo.ca/implementing_apm">Adaptive Phased
Management</a> approach for the safe and secure long-term
management of used nuclear fuel.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/department">Natural Resources
Canada</a> (NRCan) is the lead government department responsible
for developing and implementing federal nuclear energy policy
across the nuclear supply chain â€“ from uranium mining to the final
disposition of waste. This includes the uranium and radioactive
waste policy, legislation development and implementation, and the
establishment and management of a nuclear civil liability and
compensation regime. NRCan administers the <em>Nuclear Fuel Waste
Act</em> and the Radioactive Waste Policy Framework on behalf of
the Minister of Natural Resources. The nuclear industry is also
subject to the <em><a href=
"http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-15.21/index.html">Canadian
Environmental Assessment Act, 2012</a></em>, the <a href=
"http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-15.31/index.html"><em>Canadian
Environmental Protection Act</em></a>, and the <a href=
"http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-14/page-7.html"><em>Fisheries
Act</em></a>.</p>
<h2>Regulatory framework for radioactive waste management</h2>

<div class="image-caption">
<p>Nuclear Safety and Control Act</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <em><a href=
"http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-28.3/">Nuclear Safety
and Control Act</a></em> (NSCA) is the enabling legislation for the
regulatory framework. The NSCA provides legislative authority that
covers the nuclear sector regulatory developments. These
developments include health and safety standards for nuclear energy
workers, environmental protection measures, security regarding
nuclear facilities and public input into the licensing process.
Regulations made under the NSCA are legally binding under the
Act.</p>
<p>The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) is Canada's
nuclear regulatory body, created under the NSCA. The CNSC's mandate
is to regulate the use of nuclear energy and materials to protect
health, safety, security and the environment; to implement Canada's
international commitments on the peaceful use of nuclear energy;
and to disseminate objective scientific, technical and regulatory
information to the public. The CNSC reports to the Parliament of
Canada through the Minister of Natural Resources. It is not part of
Natural Resources Canada; however, the Minister of Natural
Resources can seek information from the CNSC on its activities.
Under the NSCA, the Governor in Council may issue to the Commission
directives of general application on broad policy matters. The
Governor in Council cannot give direction to the Commission on
specific licensing matters.</p>
<p>The CNSC is a federal regulatory agency and an independent
administrative tribunal set up at arm's length from the government,
with no ties to the nuclear industry. To serve Canadians, the
ultimate outcome of the CNSC's work must be the establishment of
safe and secure nuclear installations and processes solely for
peaceful purposes and public confidence in the nuclear regulatory
regime's effectiveness.</p>
<p>The CNSC licenses, monitors and inspects nuclear facilities,
including radioactive waste management facilities in order to
protect the health, safety and security of Canadians and the
environment. The CNSC operates within a modern and robust <a href=
"/sites/default/files/P-299FinalPublicationApril05_e.pdf">P-299,
<em>Regulatory Fundamentals</em></a>, <a href=
"/pubs_catalogue/uploads/P290_e.pdf">P-290, <em>Managing
Radioactive Waste</em></a>, <a href=
"/pubs_catalogue/uploads/March-2012-RDGD-370-Management-of-Uranium-Mine-Waste-Rock-and-Mill-Tailings_e.pdf">
RD/GD-370, <em>Management of Uranium Mine Waste Rock and Mill
Tailings</em></a>, and <a href=
"/pubs_catalogue/uploads/G-320_Final_e.pdf">G-320, <em>Assessing
the Long Term Safety of Radioactive Waste Management</em></a>. In
developing these documents, the CNSC draws upon recommendations of
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and best practices
from the international and national community.</p>
<p>CNSC staff actively participate in the development of
international and national standards with respect to radioactive
waste. CNSC experts sit on the IAEA's Waste Safety Standards
Committee, the Nuclear Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management
Committee, and the <a href="https://www.csagroup.org">CSA Group</a>
N292 technical committee on radioactive waste.</p>
<p>In July 2004, the CNSC issued regulatory policy P-290,
<em>Managing Radioactive Waste</em>, following extensive
consultation with the public and industry stakeholders. The policy
outlines the philosophy and six principles that govern the CNSC's
regulation of radioactive waste. It is fully consistent with the
federal Radioactive Waste Policy Framework. P-290 identifies the
need for long-term management of radioactive and hazardous waste
arising from licensed activities.</p>
<p>The policy statement in P-290 defines radioactive waste as any
form of waste material containing a nuclear substance as defined in
the NSCA. This definition is sufficiently comprehensive to include
used fuel without any other special consideration. The policy
indicates that, when making regulatory decisions about the
management of radioactive waste, the CNSC will seek to achieve its
objectives by considering certain key principles in the context of
the facts and circumstances of each case, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The generation of radioactive waste is minimized to the extent
practicable by the implementation of design measures, operating
procedures and decommissioning practices.</li>
<li>The management of radioactive waste is commensurate with its
radiological, chemical and biological hazard to the health and
safety of persons, the environment and to national security.</li>
<li>The assessment of future impacts of radioactive waste on the
health and safety of persons and the environment encompasses the
period of time in which the maximum impact is predicted to
occur.</li>
<li>The predicted impacts on the health and safety of persons and
the environment from the management of radioactive waste are no
greater than the impacts that are permissible in Canada at the time
of the regulatory decision.</li>
<li>The measures needed to prevent unreasonable risk to present and
future generations from the hazards of radioactive waste are
developed, funded and implemented as soon as reasonably
practicable.</li>
<li>The transborder effects on the health and safety of persons and
the environment, which could result from the management of
radioactive waste in Canada, are not greater than the effects
experienced in Canada.</li>
</ul>
<p>The principles contained in P-290 are consistent with those
recommended by the IAEA. P-290 also recognizes the CNSC's
commitment to optimizing regulatory efforts, stating that the CNSC
should consult and cooperate with provincial, national and
international agencies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>promote harmonized regulation and consistent national and
international standards for the management of radioactive
waste</li>
<li>achieve conformity with the measures of control and
international obligations to which Canada has agreed concerning
radioactive waste</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the CNSC's non-prescriptive approach to regulation, the
applicant proposes a waste management approach, supported by
scientifically defensible benchmarks. The CNSC then assesses the
proposal against existing regulatory requirements to ensure the
health, safety and security of the public and the protection of the
environment.</p>
<h2>Classification of radioactive waste in Canada</h2>
<p>The CSA Group â€“ in collaboration with industry, government and
the CNSC â€“ developed a standard that includes a radioactive waste
classification system (CSA 292.0-14), which takes into account
<a href=
"https://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/Pub1419_web.pdf">IAEA
safety guide GSG-1, <em>Classification of Radioactive
Waste</em></a>, along with the needs of the Canadian industry.
Published in 2014, CSA 292.0-14 recognizes four main classes of
radioactive waste:</p>
<ul>
<li>high-level radioactive waste (HLW)</li>
<li>intermediate-level radioactive waste (ILW)</li>
<li>low-level radioactive waste (LLW)</li>
<li>uranium mine and mill waste</li>
</ul>
<p>The radioactive waste classification system is organized
according to the degree of containment and isolation required to
ensure safety in the short and long terms. The classification
system also takes into consideration the hazard potential of
different types of radioactive waste. In annex A (informative) of
CSA N292.0-14, the CSA Group outlines the following radiological
parameters for the classification of radioactive waste:</p>

<h2>Regulatory framework for decommissioning</h2>
<p>In accordance with CNSC regulatory guide <a href=
"/pubs_catalogue/uploads/G219_e.pdf">G-219, <em>Decommissioning
Planning for Licensed Activities</em></a>, Class I nuclear
facilities and uranium mines and mills licensees are required to
keep decommissioning plans up to date throughout the lifecycle of a
licensed activity. In addition, the CNSC requires that all
licensees implement <a href=
"/pubs_catalogue/uploads/G206_e.pdf">financial guarantees</a> to
cover the cost of decommissioning work resulting from the licensed
activities. Decommissioning plans that assume the need for
post-closure licensing, monitoring, surveillance and maintenance of
the decommissioned activities must include financial provisions for
these actions.</p>
<p>The CNSC requires licensees to prepare a preliminary
decommissioning plan (PDP) and a detailed decommissioning plan
(DDP) for approval. The PDP must be filed with the CNSC as early as
possible in the lifecycle of the activity or facility and must be
reviewed and updated:</p>
<ul>
<li>every five years</li>
<li>when operational experience is gained or technological
advancements are made</li>
<li>when requested by the Commission or a person authorized by the
Commission</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
In the case of nuclear facilities, specific requirements for
decommissioning planning are set out in the CNSC regulations for
Class I and Class II nuclear facilities and for uranium mines and
mills.</p>
<p>The PDP documents the preferred decommissioning strategy â€“
whether it is prompt decommissioning, deferred decommissioning or
<em>in situ</em> confinement â€“ along with objectives at the end of
decommissioning. The plan should be sufficiently detailed to assure
the proposed approach is technically and financially feasible. It
must also be in the interests of health, safety, security and
environmental protection. The plan defines areas to be
decommissioned, the general structure and the sequence of the
principal decommissioning work envisioned, and it includes proposed
strategies for managing all waste. The licensee's financial
guarantee must cover the projected cost of the waste management
option proposed.</p>
<p>The DDP is filed with the CNSC prior to decommissioning and is
required for appropriate licensing action (i.e., licence to
authorize decommissioning). The DDP refines and adds procedural and
organizational details to the PDP.</p>
<p>The CSA Group standard, <em>Decommissioning of Facilities
Containing Nuclear Substances</em>, states that strategies for
waste management must consider and prioritize the recycling or
reuse of equipment and materials to reduce the volume of
radioactive waste. Minimizing radioactive waste is also a key
principle in the CSA standard on the management of low- and
intermediate-level radioactive waste which specifically refers to
the development of a waste management program to reduce the overall
volume of radioactive waste requiring long-term management. The
program may include features such as delay and decay, as well as
conditional and unconditional clearfixance.</p>
<p>Decommissioning strategies are not prescribed by the CNSC.
Proponents must propose their preferred strategy as part of their
PDP and must support it with a safety case. Any proposed
decommissioning strategy will be assessed by the CNSC against
regulatory requirements to ensure the protection of health and
safety of the public and the environment.</p>
<p>The following preliminary decommissioning plans for nuclear
power plants and associated waste management facilities are
available to the public and posted on the licensees' websites:</p>

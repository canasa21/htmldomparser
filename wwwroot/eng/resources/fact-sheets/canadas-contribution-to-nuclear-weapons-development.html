<figcaption class="image-caption">Chalk River Laboratories,
February 1954. Located about 200 km north of Ottawa, Ontario, Chalk
River Laboratories buildings contained the ZEEP, NRX and NRU
reactors (under construction). Originally part of an effort to
produce plutonium for nuclear weapons, the ZEEP reactor was
designed by a team of Canadian, British and French scientists and
engineers during the Second World War.</figcaption>

<p>The extraction and processing of uranium as well as research
into the production of nuclear materials for military purposes are
part of Canada's history. The better-known chapter of that history
is probably Canada's participation in the <a href=
"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/362098/Manhattan-Project">
Manhattan Project</a> during the Second World War (WWII), when our
country supplied and refined uranium for use in U.S. facilities.
Canada continued to be a supplier of uranium for military purposes
for two decades after the war.</p>
<p>Less well known to most, perhaps, is our involvement in research
to produce and extract plutonium as part of the Manhattan Project,
which ended in 1946. Canada also sold irradiated (used) nuclear
fuel, from which plutonium was extracted, to the U.S. between 1959
and 1964. All transfers of nuclear materials for non-peaceful
purposes were halted the following year.</p>

<h2>A wartime decision</h2>
<p>It was in the midst of WWII, on August 17, 1942, that Canada
formally decided to enter the nuclear age. The British government
was looking for a partner to relocate its Cambridge-based nuclear
laboratory during the war to facilitate collaboration with the U.S.
in developing nuclear weapons. After negotiations between the
United Kingdom and Canada, agreement was reached. C.D. Howe,
Minister of Canada's wartime Department of Munitions and Supply,
famously gave the go ahead for the Montreal Laboratory (forerunner
of the Chalk River Laboratories) with the simple words “Okay, let's
go." The laboratory would become associated with the U.S. Manhattan
Project, which would build a nuclear bomb.</p>
<p>A year later, the <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_Agreement">Québec
Agreement</a> between the UK and the U.S. was signed by Winston
Churchill and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. This multinational
agreement sealed the general terms which would later define
Canada's role in the Manhattan Project and the nuclear weapons
programs of the Allies.</p>
<h2>Uranium</h2>
<p>The early expansion of Canada's uranium industry was driven by
the military's interest in the development and production of
nuclear weapons. During WWII, a Canadian company, Eldorado Gold
Mining Company, reopened a recently closed radium mine, (the
presence of radium is closely associated with that of uranium) to
supply the U.S. military with the uranium needed to produce the
nuclear bomb.</p>
<p>From the mine, located near Great Bear Lake in the Northwest
Territories, uranium-bearing ore was extracted and shipped
thousands of kilometres to Eldorado's milling and refining facility
in Port Hope, Ontario. In 1942, the federal government purchased
and nationalized Eldorado's uranium-related assets.</p>
<p>For the duration of WWII, Eldorado's Port Hope facility refined
ore from many countries, including the U.S. and what is now the
Democratic Republic of Congo, in response to the overwhelming
demand for uranium driven by the Manhattan Project.</p>

mine was reopened to supply the U.S. with the uranium needed to
develop the nuclear bomb. Because of its strategic importance, the
Canadian government bought the company one year after.</figcaption>

<h2>Plutonium</h2>
<p>During WWII, Canada joined the U.S. and the UK in their efforts
to produce a nuclear bomb. The fission of uranium, the method used
to harness the energy found within the atom, was discovered in
1939. By the end of 1942, the UK and Canada had established the
Montreal Laboratory to develop nuclear weapons. Scientists from
both nations and from France collaborated to design the <a href=
"http://www.sciencetech.technomuses.ca/english/whatson/zeep.cfm">ZEEP
(zero energy experimental pile)</a> reactor.</p>
<p>The ZEEP, housed in Chalk River, Ontario, was a small prototype
reactor constructed to prove that natural uranium and heavy water
could be used to create and sustain nuclear fission (also known as
achieving “criticality"). The reactor was also used to demonstrate
the design's potential to generate plutonium – an artificially
created fissile material that can be extracted chemically from
irradiated uranium fuel – for the Allies' military programs. The
first reactor to achieve criticality outside the U.S. (in September
1945), the ZEEP served as the basis for the design of the NRX
(National Research Experimental) reactor.</p>

<p><strong>Heavy water production</strong> – Cominco, in Trail,
British Columbia, produced and supplied heavy water for the
Manhattan Project, mainly to U.S. military facilities. It sold the
product until 1956.</p>
</div>
<h2>Post-WWII period</h2>
<p>Following the war, the global demand for uranium continued to be
driven by military uses.</p>
<p>Many Canadian communities experienced rapid growth in the
post-war period as a result of the burgeoning mining industry.
Uranium City, in Northern Saskatchewan, hosted a number of mining
operations comprising several mines and two mills. Two Ontario
areas – Bancroft and Elliot Lake – also experienced a boom in
uranium mining activities. Elliot Lake would come to be recognized
as the “Uranium Capital" of the world, with over 12 mines and
several nearby mills, operated by Denison Mines and Rio Algom.</p>

<p>Solar flares, also called coronal mass ejections, occur at the
surface of the sun and are linked to the release of enormous
amounts of energy and particles that travel rapidly in space.
Canadian nuclear power plants are protected against the potential
disruptions that could be caused by large solar flares.</p>
<p>While the particles can generate astounding visual effects like
the Northern Lights when they reach the Earth, they can also cause
power fluctuations and disruptions in the electrical grid and
telecommunication systems.</p>
<p>The loss of power in the electrical grid to cool the reactor and
the used fuel pools – whether caused by solar flares or by any
other event – has been taken into account by reactor designers,
operators and the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) in
developing and enforcing regulations.</p>
<h3>What would happen?</h3>
<p>The phenomenon of solar flares is well understood. If power is
lost or in the event of a power surge due to disturbances caused by
intense solar flare activity, the reactor's electrical distribution
system would automatically be disconnected from the grid to protect
the transformers and generators. This would be followed by an
immediate automatic reactor shutdown.</p>
<p>Backup electrical supply provided by standby generators would
then replace lost power to ensure the continued cooling of the
reactor core and used fuel storage pools. A further set of
emergency generators in case the standby generators fail, as well
as multiple days worth of fuel, are available onsite to ensure
continued operation.</p>
<p>CANDU reactors are also built in a way that make it possible to
cool them without electricity for a period of time, while the
necessary work to reestablish the power supply can be
performed.</p>
<h3>What if?</h3>
<p>Nuclear power plants in Canada and their electrical systems are
constructed according to the principles of “defence in depth,"
which means that several layers of backup safety systems are built
into their designs. In other words, if one safety system fails, the
reactor and ultimately the public are protected by other systems.
For example, CANDU reactors are equipped with two fast acting
independent and equally effective shutdown systems that do not
require a power supply.</p>
<h3>Did you know?</h3>
<p>In March 1989, a solar storm was responsible for leaving six
million people in Québec, Canada, without power for nine hours. The
Gentilly-2 nuclear power plant, located in Bécancour, Québec, lost
regular grid power. Standby generators automatically started as
planned.</p>
<p>While rare, North American power utilities have now implemented
safety mechanisms to protect power grids from power fluctuations
that could be caused by solar flares.</p>

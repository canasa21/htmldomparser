<title>Naturally occurring radioactive material</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Naturally occurring radiative material (NORM) is material found
in the environment that contains radioactive elements of natural
origin. NORM primarily contains uranium and thorium (elements that
also release radium and radon gas once they begin to decay) and
potassium. These elements are naturally decaying and are considered
a primary contributor to an individual's yearly background
radiation dose.</p>

<h2>Where can NORM be found?</h2>
<p>NORM is often found in its natural state in rocks or sand. It
can also be associated with oil and gas production residue (such as
mineral scale in pipes, sludge and contaminated equipment), coal
ash (produced from burning coal for energy production) and on
filter media (such as the used filters from municipal drinking
water treatment equipment). NORM can also be present in consumer
products, including common building products (like brick and cement
blocks), granite counter tops, glazed tiles, phosphate fertilizers
and tobacco products.</p>
<p>Some industries may regularly come into contact with NORM – for
instance, those engaged in the production of oil and gas, phosphate
fertilizers, forest products and thermal electricity; mineral
extraction and processing; tunneling and underground workings;
metal recycling; waste management; and water treatment.</p>

<h3>Did you know?</h3>
<ul>
<li>NORM is material naturally found in the environment that
contains radioactive elements.</li>
<li>The handling and disposal of NORM within Canada is regulated by
the provincial and territorial governments.</li>
<li>The transport, import and export of NORM must follow Canadian
Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) regulations.</li>
<li>NORM-contaminated equipment and waste should only be handled by
a person with appropriate radiation training.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How is NORM regulated?</h2>
<p>In Canada, NORM is regulated by the provincial and territorial
governments, each having its own specific regulations on the
handling and disposal of the material. The <a href=
"https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/publications/health-risks-safety/canadian-guidelines-management-naturally-occurring-radioactive-materials.html">
Canadian Guidelines for the Management of Naturally Occurring
Radioactive Materials</a> have been developed by the Federal
Provincial Territorial Radiation Protection Committee (FPtrPC) to
harmonize standards throughout the country and ensure appropriate
control over NORM; however, provincial regulations should also be
consulted.</p>
<p>NORM is exempt from the application of the <a href=
"http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-28.3/index.html"><em>Nuclear
Safety and Control Act</em></a> and its regulations except under
the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>when NORM is associated with the development, production or use
of nuclear energy as set out in the <em><a href=
"http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2000-202/page-1.html">
General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations</a></em></li>
<li>when NORM is imported into Canada or exported from Canada as
set out in the <em><a href=
"http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2000-210/page-1.html">
Nuclear Non-proliferation Import and Export Control
Regulations</a></em></li>
<li>the transport of NORM when the specific activity is greater
than 70 Bq/g (70 kBq/kg) as set out in the <em><a href=
"http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2000-208/index.html">

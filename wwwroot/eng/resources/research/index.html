        <body><p>The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) integrates the best available science with its decision making. The CNSC maintains research initiatives and programs to ensure it keeps abreast of new scientific information, develops its own knowledge base and shares its research findings with stakeholders and scientists in Canada and abroad.</p> <p>Research is carried out on a wide range of topics, from <a href="/sites/default/files/CNSC-Research-Report-2015-2016-eng.pdf"><em>The Science of Safety &ndash; CNSC Research Report 2015&ndash;16</em></a> (PDF)</li> <li><a href="http://www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca/pubs_catalogue/uploads/CNSC-Research-Report-2014-2015-eng.pdf"><em>The Science of Safety &ndash; CNSC Research Report 2014&ndash;15</em></a> (PDF)</li> </ul> <p>The CNSC funds an extramural research program called the Research and Support Program. This program provides the CNSC with access to independent advice, expertise, experience, information and other resources via contracts, grants and contributions placed in the private sector, and with other agencies and organizations in Canada and elsewhere. Reports completed through the research program are not published as CNSC reports; abstracts of the reports are available instead.</p> <ul> <li><a href="/eng/resources/research/research-and-support-program/index.cfm">Research report abstracts</a></li> </ul> <h2>Research projects and collaborations</h2> <p>We work in partnership with leading research bodies in Canada and around the world. Some of our research collaborations are listed below.</p> <p><a href="/eng/resources/research/cohere/index.cfm">Canadian Organization on Health Effects from Radiation Exposure (COHERE)</a></p> <p>COHERE aims to improve understanding of the potential health impacts from exposure to low doses of radiation.</p> <h2>Technical papers and articles</h2> <p>The CNSC values the use of independent peer reviews and encourages technical staff to submit articles for publication in scientific journals and make presentations about the nuclear industry.</p> <ul> <li><a href="/eng/resources/research/technical-papers-and-articles/index.cfm">Technical papers, presentations and articles</a></li> </ul> </div> </div> </div></body>

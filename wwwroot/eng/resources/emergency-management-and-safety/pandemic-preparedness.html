<p>We always put the safety of the public and the environment
first. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic we have been
closely monitoring the situation at all nuclear facilities to
ensure the public and the environment remain protected.</p>
<h2>2021</h2>
<p>On November 8, the CNSC implemented a mandatory vaccination
policy, mirroring the policy framework of the Government of Canada.
This policy is a term and condition of employment, and applies to
employees working in the office, remotely or from a telework
location, as per the definition of the workplace under Part II of
the <em>Canada Labour Code</em>.</p>
<p><strong>For CNSC employees:</strong></p>
<p>Employees are required to attest to their vaccination status
between November 19 and 30.</p>
<p><strong>For CNSC suppliers:</strong></p>
<p>The CNSC is subject to Treasury Board Secretariat procurement
policies, and will apply the policy and timelines dictated by
Public Services and Procurement Canada. To that end, suppliers and
sub-contractors who require access to CNSC-occupied workplaces will
be asked to complete a certification form attesting that their
personnel are vaccinated. This requirement comes into effect
November 15.</p>
<p><strong>For visitors to the CNSC:</strong></p>
<p>Effective November 15, visitors (non-employees and
non-suppliers) must show proof of vaccination and identification to
enter CNSC workplaces. Guests who cannot show proof of vaccination
will not be granted access beyond the security checkpoint. CNSC
employees will inform their visitors to have the required proof of
vaccination ready for verification immediately upon arrival.</p>
<p>As vaccination efforts continue and parts of Canada begin to
reopen, the CNSC continues to monitor licensees and sites to
respect its mandate of protecting the health and safety of
Canadians and the environment. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>continuing to provide essential calibration and instrument
management services at the CNSC lab by implementing clearfix
COVID-19 protocols, including limited occupancy, heightened
security and enhanced disinfecting measures to keep onsite
employees safe</li>
<li>maintaining collaboration with international counterparts
virtually in order to share best practices and lessons learned on
operational changes, such as staff teleworking and adoption of
virtual Commission meetings and hearings</li>
<li>transitioning to onsite inspections with COVID-19 safety
precautions in place, and leveraging remote specialist support and
compliance verification for nuclear facilities</li>
<li>requiring all nuclear facilities to adopt provincial
government-mandated protocols such as masks, hand washing,
sanitation stations, temperature monitoring and physical
distancing</li>
<li>requiring nuclear facilities to maintain their minimum shift
complement, which is a minimum number of essential workers required
onsite to maintain safe operations</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>Jean-Claude Poirier, a Senior Project Officer at the CNSC, is
being recognized for his outstanding contributions to Canada’s
response to COVID-19 for his recent work with the Public Health
Agency of Canada, where he advised on the implementation and
enforcement of the <em>Quarantine Act</em>.</p>
</div>
<h2>December 2020</h2>
<h3>Suspended operations due to COVID-19</h3>
<p>In December, production was suspended by Orano Canada Inc. at
its McClean Lake Uranium Mill and by Cameco at its Cigar Lake
Uranium Mine. These suspensions moved in tandem with the increasing
risks posed by the pandemic in northern Saskatchewan. Both Orano
and Cameco must maintain the necessary resources and essential
services to operate critical systems and to ensure they continue to
meet regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>As an agile regulator, our framework requires licensees to have
specific plans and processes in place for suspending operation, and
for returning the facilities to production following suspension.
Both during and after suspension, CNSC staff continue to verify
licensees are following approved programs.</p>
<h2>November 2020</h2>
<h3>Successful first virtual Commission hearing</h3>
<p>November marks the first fully virtual Commission hearing in the
CNSC’s history. Commission meetings were also held virtually in
June, September and November 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions;
future proceedings are set to continue to be conducted online
during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Commission proceedings are an essential part of ensuring safe
nuclear regulation in Canada. Independent Commission members must
remain updated on nuclear activities and continue to make decisions
on nuclear licences.</p>
<p>The CNSC established the Official Guidelines for CNSC Virtual
Proceedings to help achieve the Commission’s objectives of making
transparent and fair decisions, while adhering to the adjustments
and accommodations needed for virtual proceedings. The Guidelines
have been the foundation for successfully navigating the three
online Commission meetings and one online Commission hearing.</p>
<p>From proper virtual etiquette and procedural information, to
technology help and contingency planning, the Guidelines assist
those involved in virtual Commission proceedings. Most importantly,
the Guidelines prioritize supporting intervenors from the public
and from Indigenous groups to share their perspectives and ensure
that their voices are considered in Commission decisions.</p>
<h2>October 2020</h2>
<h3>Innovation in a resurgence of COVID-19</h3>
<p>Like all Canadians, we at the CNSC respond to the challenges
posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. We look for and implement best
practices and innovative approaches that allow us to deliver our
mandate without compromising the safety of our employees. In
particular, CNSC staff take full advantage of modern technology to
perform many of our verification activities remotely. CNSC staff
continue to use risk assessments to make sure that
safety-significant activities get adequate regulatory
oversight.</p>
<p>As an example, in the case of independent environmental testing,
Ottawa staff have worked in tandem with regional colleagues to
ensure that regulatory oversight can continue. When staff in the
National Capital Region could not travel to conduct environmental
testing in the vicinity of the Point Lepreau Generating Station,
they came up with a creative solution. Remote training was offered
by specialists in Ottawa, and CNSC site staff learned how to
collect water, sand, soil and vegetation samples to be analyzed for
radiological contaminants. Their ability to innovate eliminated the
need for interprovincial travel, while ensuring that the testing
done to help confirm the safety of Canadians and the environment
could happen.</p>
<h2>September 2020</h2>
<h3>President Velshi interviewed on the safety preparedness of the
nuclear sector during COVID-19</h3>
<p>Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak
of 2003, the nuclear sector prepared robust business contingency
plans that incorporated lessons learned and foresight for future
crises.</p>
<p>In an interview with Global News, CNSC President Rumina Velshi
credited the nuclear sector’s quick response to the COVID-19
pandemic to its preparedness. Licensees had “what if” plans and
stockpiles of personal protective equipment, while our strong and
agile regulatory framework allowed us to focus on critical
facilities and activities to keep Canadians and the environment
safe.</p>
<p>Implementing contingency plans has maintained regulatory
oversight and safe operations throughout the pandemic.</p>

<h3>Aligned with international best practices on regulatory
oversight during COVID-19</h3>
<p>Inspections are an essential part of nuclear safety. Since the
beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, nuclear regulatory bodies
around the world have implemented new protocols and measures to
mitigate the pandemic’s impact on nuclear power plant
inspections.</p>
<p>To compare nuclear regulatory oversight in Canada with that of
our counterparts in other countries, we conducted an international
benchmarking exercise on inspection practices. We solicited
information from 19 member countries of the Nuclear Energy Agency
Working Group on Inspection Practices, including the United States,
the United Kingdom and France. Data showed that 84% of regulatory
bodies had reduced their onsite presence to varying degrees,
consistent with our approach. While we suspended our onsite
presence from March 16 to May 4, 2020, our regulatory oversight and
inspections never stopped and CNSC staff were ready to respond to
emergencies at anytime. We established a framework for conducting
remote oversight activities and inspections, which included working
with licensees to ensure remote access to site information systems.
We were always ready to deploy inspectors onsite if there was a
significant event.</p>
<p>In May 2020, we resumed onsite inspections at nuclear power
plants prioritized based on the level of risk. Also inspections
have been adapted in light of the pandemic: CNSC inspectors and
subject matter experts follow government-mandated COVID-19
protocols, including those for physical distancing, hygiene
practices and personal protective equipment.</p>
<p>We continue to be in line with our international counterparts on
best practices for oversight activities – ensuring that the
protection of Canadians is as strong now as it was before the
pandemic.</p>
<h2>August 2020</h2>
<h3>Commission grants extension for completion of beryllium
analysis now that resampling is complete for BWXT’s Peterborough
location</h3>
<p>In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, CNSC staff requested
and have been granted a two-month extension to complete the
analysis process for the beryllium resampling that was recently
conducted at properties adjacent to BWXT’s Peterborough, Ontario,
facility. The extension was requested by staff to ensure the
remaining work is in accordance with health and safety protocols
and includes additional precautions to support staff working in the
CNSC lab to analyze the samples. Link to the Commission decision
<a href=

here</a>.</p>
<h3>Commission grants exemption for nuclear power plants</h3>
<p>As a result of COVID-19, Ontario Power Generation, New Brunswick
Power and Bruce Power requested an extension to allow more time to
conduct certification requalification testing programs. Following
technical assessments of the requests on the advice of CNSC staff,
the Commission concluded that a six-month extension would give
shift workers whose certification is expiring between July and
December 2020 sufficient time to complete their requalification
testing while ensuring the continued safe operation of the nuclear
power plants.</p>
<p>Requalification tests and requirements are outlined in
REGDOC-2.2.3, Personnel Certification, Volume III: Certification of
Persons Working at Nuclear Power Plants, which forms part of the
licensees’ licensing bases. Link to the Commission decision

<h3>CNSC involvement in multilateral organizations’ COVID-19
related work</h3>
<p>The CNSC is actively involved in COVID-19 related work conducted
by international organizations. We are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Playing a leadership role as chair of the International Atomic
Energy Agency’s (IAEA) Commission on Safety Standards, by
participating in discussions about pandemic response.</li>
<li>Sharing experience about our response to the pandemic by
participating in meetings and delivering presentations.</li>
<li>Collaborating on the sharing of best practices for conducting
remote inspections and return to the workplace.</li>
</ul>
<h2>July 2020</h2>
<h3>How nuclear facilities are safely adapting during the
pandemic</h3>
<p>At the June Commission meeting, representatives from nuclear
power plants and nuclear fuel cycle facilities presented on how
they are adapting to ensure safe, ongoing operations during the
pandemic. These presentations are now publicly available on our
YouTube page at the following links:</p>

</ul>
<h3>CNSC assists international regulatory community during
pandemic</h3>
<p>As we perform our domestic regulatory work during the pandemic,
the CNSC continues to provide leadership internationally by
assisting the IAEA and partner countries where possible.</p>
<p>The IAEA recently engaged the CNSC for assistance in issuing a
required transport licence for transit through Canada for a
shipment between European and South American partner
countries.&nbsp; As a result of pandemic lockdown measures, two
Type B(U) packages were stranded on route to their final
destination in Lima, Peru.</p>
<p>Acting as an intermediary, CNSC staff provided guidance on the
licence application, and reviewed and processed the transport
licence within two days. The packages were safely delivered to
their end destination in accordance with CNSC Packaging and
Transport of Nuclear Substances Regulations for such shipments
transiting Canada.</p>
<p>The IAEA and stakeholders involved were very appreciative of the
assistance and quick response by CNSC staff to resolve this
situation.</p>
<h2>June 2020</h2>
<h3>Commission hosts first virtual public meeting</h3>
<p>We’re carrying out our regulatory work during the pandemic while
respecting physical distancing and other restrictions. The
Commission meeting scheduled for June 17-18 was held virtually and
was accessible via webcast for the public. Presenters and
Commission members participated remotely.</p>
<h2>May 2020</h2>
<h3>Regulatory flexibility</h3>
<p>Due to the impacts of COVID-19, the nuclear industry is
requesting regulatory flexibility for some ongoing training and
certification requirements. We’re reviewing each request for
extension on a case-by-case basis – safety is our top priority.</p>
<h3>President visits Darlington site</h3>
<div class="span-3 pull-right"><img src=
"./images/covid19-president-darlington.jpg" alt=
"President visits Darlington site" /></div>
<p>On May 21, CNSC President Rumina Velshi and Executive
Vice-President Ramzi Jammal visited Ontario Power Generation’s
Darlington site to get a first-hand look at how they’re
implementing rigorous physical distancing, safety precautions and
PPE use to minimize risk during this pandemic.</p>
<h2>April 2020</h2>
<h3>Regulatory oversight during the pandemic</h3>
<p>The CNSC is available 24/7 to respond to any emergency, and
remains committed to strong and effective regulatory oversight of
Canada’s nuclear sector. Here’s a breakdown of how we’re
maintaining effective regulatory oversight during the pandemic:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ve established an internal communications infrastructure to
keep all employees informed of their role during this time, and to
offer guidance and updates in support of their physical and mental
health.</li>
<li>All critical CNSC staff continue to work and have the necessary
tools to maintain key regulatory activities.</li>
<li>We’re prioritizing our work to focus on the needs of those
providing essential services, like nuclear power plants, hospitals,
isotope producers, sterilization facilities and border
security.</li>
<li>We’re ensuring that providers of services critical to Canada’s
infrastructure – such as equipment sterilization and the supply of
radioisotopes for medical treatment – are able to meet their
licensing and certification requirements efficiently.</li>
<li>Our inspectors continue to have access to licensed facilities
as needed to respond to safety issues, and are following the advice
of health officials to practise physical distancing when
onsite.</li>
<li>We’re remaining in constant communication with licensees to
ensure that regulatory requirements to protect health, safety and
security of workers, and the environment, remain in place.</li>
<li>We’re maintaining regulatory oversight of the measures
licensees are taking to help fight the spread of the virus,
including staffing changes and modifications to non-essential
work.</li>
<li>We’re being flexible with licensees, understanding that they
will need more time to report to the CNSC on issues that are not
safety significant.</li>
<li>We’re postponing the public Commission proceedings for April
and June and exploring options for holding the proceedings
remotely.</li>
</ul>
<h2>March 2020</h2>
<h3>Commission proceeding dates</h3>
<p>In its continued response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CNSC is
postponing and making changes to upcoming Commission proceedings.
None of these changes impacts public safety. Revised notices with
relevant details will be issued as soon as they are available.</p>
<p>Here are the highlights of the changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The April Commission meeting is postponed to June 17-18, 2020
and may be held virtually.</li>
<li>The June public hearing on an amendment to the Douglas Point
Waste Facility decommissioning licence is being rescheduled to
August 19-20, 2020.</li>
<li>The document deadlines for the Global First Power hearing in
writing have been extended by 30 days. The CNSC staff document will
be available by May 1; interventions are due June 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>We continue to monitor the pandemic situation and are focusing
on critical services to ensure that nuclear facilities are safe and
that the public and environment are protected.</p>
<h3>Critical staff activated</h3>
<p>During the current COVID-19 pandemic, we're doing our part and
heeding guidance from medical officials to help reduce the spread
of the virus. As such, effective March 16, 2020, CNSC staff have
been directed to stay home, while critical staff continue to work
to ensure effective regulatory oversight.</p>
<p>We remain actively engaged with licensees to ensure the
protection of the public and the environment and will continue to
provide updates as required.</p>
<p>Let's all do what we can to flatten the curve and keep each
other healthy.</p>
<h3>Pandemic preparedness</h3>
<p>As the Canadian nuclear regulator, we put the safety of the
public and the environment first. During the current COVID-19
pandemic, the CNSC is monitoring the situation at all nuclear
facilities to ensure the public and the environment are
protected.</p>
<p>Nuclear operators, as CNSC licensees, are required to develop
and implement a business continuity plan to ensure their facilities
continue to operate safely at all times, including during a
pandemic. Business continuity plans address how to deal with
possible labour disruptions while maintaining key staffing
positions. These plans can be activated during any interruption of
normal operation, and include ways to ensure safe facility
operation, even during widespread absenteeism.</p>
<p>As a regulator, the CNSC also has a business continuity plan to
ensure our strong and effective regulatory oversight. We remain
actively engaged with licensees during the COVID-19 pandemic, and
will continue to provide updates on the safety of nuclear
facilities as required.</p>

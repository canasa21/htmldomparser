<p><strong>These forms may be updated from time-to-time, so please
ensure that you always use the most current version available form
on the web site.</strong></p>
<p>Open the ACR document then select the applicable form from the
drop-down list and click the “Generate Form” btn to apply your
selection. The ACR forms are customized for the activity authorized
by the licence. The licensed activity name and number (e.g. 812 -
industrial radiography), can be found on each licence under section
IV <em>Licensed Activities</em>.</p>
<p>If you selected the wrong licensed activity, in order to change
it, go back to the drop-down list then select the correct licensed
activity and then click on the “Generate Form” btn to create the
correct ACR form.</p>
<p>To request a hard copy of the ACR form, please send your request
to <a href=
"mailto:dnsr-info-drsn@cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca">dnsr-info-drsn@cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca</a>.</p>

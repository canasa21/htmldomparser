<title>Packaging and transport of nuclear substances</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>All nuclear substances are transported in packages that are
selected based on the nature, form, and quantity or activity of the
substance. There are general design requirements that apply to all
package types to ensure that they can be handled safely and easily,
secured properly, and are able to withstand routine transport
conditions.</p>
<p>The CNSC issues licences and certificates for certain kinds of
packaging and transport of nuclear substances as stipulated in the
<cite><a href=
"http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2015-145/index.html">
Packaging and Transport of Nuclear Substances Regulations,
2015</a></cite> (PTNSR 2015). These regulations are based on the
International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) SSR-6, <cite><a href=
"https://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/PUB1798_web.pdf">Regulations
for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material, 2018
Edition</a></cite> (PDF, 190 pages, 1.7 MB). The licences and
certificates include:</p>
<ul>
<li>licence to transport Category I, II or III nuclear
material</li>
<li>licence to transport nuclear substances while in transit</li>
<li>licence to transport nuclear substances contained in large
objects</li>
<li>licence to transport nuclear substances when the transport
cannot meet all of the regulatory requirements</li>
<li>licence to transport nuclear substances that require a
multilateral approval of shipments</li>
<li>licence to transport nuclear substances that require a special
use vessel</li>
<li>certificates for the design of packages and special form
radioactive material</li>
</ul>
<p>The PTNSR 2015 introduce an ambulatory reference to the IAEA
Regulations and no longer explicitly identify and list relevant
paragraphs from them. This change ensures that Canadian regulations
will continue to align with international regulations if
international regulations are modified.</p>
<p>In February 2016, the CNSC published <a href=
"/sites/default/files/PUB1798_web.pdf">Regulations for the Safe
Transport of Radioactive Material, 2018 Edition</a> (PDF, 190
pages, 1.7 MB), and must provide adequate compensatory measures to
ensure the safety of the shipment under the PTNS regulations.</p>
<h2>Category I, II and III nuclear material</h2>
<p>A CNSC licence to transport Category I, II or III nuclear
material is required to transport material that is defined in
section 1 of the <cite><a href=
"http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/PDF/Regulation/S/SOR-2000-209.pdf">Nuclear
Security Regulations</a></cite> (PDF), such as plutonium, various
grades of unirradiated uranium-235 and irradiated fuels consisting
of depleted or natural uranium, thorium or low-enriched fuel.</p>
<p>Read about the <a href="/sites/default/files/G208_e.pdf">G-208,
<cite>Transportation Security Plans for Category I, II or III
Nuclear Material</cite></a> (PDF) offers assistance in preparing a
written transportation security plan as required under section 5 of
the <cite>Nuclear Security Regulations</cite> when applying for
these licences.</p>

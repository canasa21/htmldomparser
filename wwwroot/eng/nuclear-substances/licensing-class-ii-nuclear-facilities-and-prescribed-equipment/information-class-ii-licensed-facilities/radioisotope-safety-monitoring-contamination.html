<title>Radioisotope Safety – Monitoring for Radioactive
Contamination</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This appendix provides general guidance for monitoring and
controlling radioactive contamination, and relating the monitoring
results to the contamination limits specified in CNSC licences. The
appendix also provides guidance on contamination monitoring
instrument selection. Certain CNSC licences authorizing the use of
unsealed nuclear substances contain a condition that states the
regulatory criteria pertaining to radioactive contamination. The
specified contamination criteria should be applied to all areas
where unsealed nuclear substances are used/present, or have been
used. Notwithstanding these limits, licensees should maintain
levels of radioactive contamination as low as reasonably achievable
(ALARA).</p>
<h2>1.0 Elements of a contamination monitoring program</h2>
<h3>1.1 Method of measurement</h3>
<p>Radioactive contamination may be measured directly or
indirectly. Direct measurement generally means the use of portable
radiation detection instruments to detect both fixed and removable
contamination. Direct measurement may be used when background
radiation levels are negligible compared to licence criteria.
Indirect measurement only detects removable contamination by means
of a sampling program.</p>
<h3>1.2 Instrument selection</h3>
<p>The ability of various radiation detection instruments to detect
radioisotopes will vary by instrument and manufacturer. Guidance on
the selection of instruments can be found in the section “Selection
of contamination monitoring instruments”. For specific information
on a particular model, contact the manufacturer.</p>
<h2>2.0 Contamination monitoring</h2>
<h3>2.1 Purpose</h3>
<p>The locations selected for contamination monitoring should be
numbered on a plan of the work area. These locations should include
working surfaces (such as benches, countertops or fume hoods),
storage areas, and non-working surfaces (such as floors,
instruments and equipment, door handles, light switches, sink taps
and telephones). Several random locations should also be monitored.
Too rigid a set of locations may overlook problem areas. The list
of locations should be reviewed at a sufficient frequency to
determine whether the list is current or new locations should be
added.</p>
<h3>2.2 Instrument checks</h3>
<p>All instruments used for counting samples, such as liquid
scintillation counters, well-type crystal gamma counters, gas-flow
proportional counters, semiconductor gamma spectrometers and gamma
cameras, should be routinely serviced according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Licensees must keep a record of the
servicing with the date. Before monitoring for contamination, all
instruments should be given operational checks as specified by the
manufacturer; i.e., battery check, high-voltage check, response
check and the background radiation level should be measured.
Licensees must keep a record of the operational checks and
background measurement. Similarly, the instruments should be used
to measure the radiation from a standard such as a check source for
every set of contamination monitoring measurements performed. The
results of those measurements allow the determination of the
instrument efficiency.</p>
<p>Instruments that are not operating within the parameters of
operational checks, or that show anomalous background, blank or
standard measurements, should not be used until their proper
operation can be verified. These instruments should be tagged
indicating that they are out of service and should not be used
until their proper operation can be verified.</p>
<h3>2.3 Frequency of contamination monitoring</h3>
<p>Contamination monitoring frequencies, which should be at least
weekly during periods of regular use, should conform to the
requirements indicated in the licensee’s radiation protection
program. When radioactive substances are not used for a prolonged
period of time, contamination monitoring is not required, but such
a period should be identified in the records.</p>
<h3>2.4 Direct measurement of contamination using a portable
meter</h3>
<p>Direct measurement instrument readings include both fixed and
non-fixed contamination. Subsequently, a direct reading may be used
to satisfy licence criteria for non-fixed contamination.</p>
<h3>2.5 Indirect measurement of contamination with wipes</h3>
<p>Perform the following steps for indirect measurements:<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Wipe each of the locations shown on the plan of the working
area with a filter paper, wipe or cottonswab lightly moistened with
alcohol or water. Use one numbered wipe per location. If
contamination isfound, the contaminated area shall be identified
and decontaminated.</li>
<li>Wipe an area of 100 cm<sup>2</sup>. Using uniform and constant
pressure, wipe the entire area. In situations wherewipes of 100
cm<sup>2</sup> areas are not feasible such as wipes of some
equipment, light switches, etc., take noteof the area of the
surface wiped and ensure the appropriate conversion factor is
applied.</li>
<li>If necessary, carefully dry the wipe to prevent loss of
activity. Since the contamination may be absorbedinto the wipe
material, the use of a wetting agent may lead to a significant
underestimate of alpha andlow-energy beta contamination with some
counting methods.</li>
<li>Count the wipes in a low-background area and record all
results.</li>
<li>If the wipes are to be counted on a contamination meter, the
wipe should be smaller than or equal to thesensitive area of the
detector. Note that the geometry of the wipe material (flat like
filter paper or roundlike a swab) may change results.</li>
<li>Clean any contaminated areas and monitor again. Record results
before and after decontamination.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.6 Decontamination</h3>
<p>Any area that is found to have non-fixed contamination exceeding
the contamination criteria shall be cleaned and monitored again. If
the area cannot be cleaned to meet those criteria, the contaminated
area shall be sealed or shielded until the criteria are met. All
non-fixed contamination should be removed if possible. Note: For
short-lived radionuclides, the room or area may be posted and
secured until the radioisotope decays.</p>
<p>Note: For short-lived radionuclides, the room or area may be
posted and secured until the radioisotope decays.</p>
<h3>2.7 Monitoring records</h3>
<p>Contamination monitoring records shall be available for
inspection by CNSC staff. These records should include:<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>date of measurement</li>
<li>make and model of the instrument</li>
<li>monitoring locations</li>
<li>contamination monitoring results in Bq/cm<sup>2</sup> before
and after decontamination, if applicable</li>
<li>results of operational checks and background measurements</li>
<li>standard measurement results</li>
<li>measured or predicted efficiency</li>
<li>instrument servicing records should be recorded and updated as
necessary</li>
<li>demonstration that the chosen instrument and counting methods
yield a minimum detectable activitybelow the applicable
criteria</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.8 Regulatory criteria for radioactive contamination</h3>
<p>The licensee shall ensure that for nuclear substances listed in
Appendix A: Classes of Nuclear Substances:<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>non-fixed contamination in all areas, rooms or enclosures where
unsealed nuclear substances areused or stored does not exceed:
<ul>
<li>3 Bq/cm<sup>2</sup> for all Class A radionuclides</li>
<li>30 Bq/cm<sup>2</sup> for all Class B radionuclides</li>
<li>300 Bq/cm<sup>2</sup> for all Class C radionuclides, averaged
over an area not exceeding 100 cm<sup>2</sup></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>non-fixed contamination in all other areas does not exceed:
<ul>
<li>0.3 Bq/cm<sup>2</sup> for all Class A radionuclides</li>
<li>3 Bq/cm<sup>2</sup> for all Class B radionuclides</li>
<li>30 Bq/cm<sup>2</sup> for all Class C radionuclides, averaged
over an area not exceeding 100 cm<sup>2</sup></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>2.8.1 Relating measurement readings to regulatory criteria</h4>
<p>The readings from contamination meters can be related to
regulatory criteria if the efficiency of the instrument for a
specific nuclear substance is known. Instrument efficiencies for
specific nuclear substances can be obtained from the manufacturer
or determined using an appropriate standard of known activity. For
mixtures of nuclear substances, identify the isotope for which the
detector has the lowest response at the applicable contamination
limit. Using the following equation, calculate the measurement
results in Bq/cm<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Where:<br />
N = the total count rate in counts per minute (cpm) measured
directly or on the wipe.<br />
NB = the normal background count rate (in cpm) from the portable
survey instrument or the count rate (in cpm) from a blank sample
using a benchtop instrument<br />
E = the instrument efficiency factor (expressed as a decimal, i.e.
for 5 percent efficiency, E=0.05) for the radioisotope being
measured. Consult the manufacturer or determine using a radioactive
source with a known amount of activity in a counting geometry
similar to that used when surveying for contamination.<br />

<p>F = the collection factor for the wipe (used only when
calculating indirect wipe monitoring results).</p>
<p>If F is not determined experimentally, a value of F=0.1 (i.e.
10%) shall be used.</p>
<h3>2.9 Minimum detectable activity</h3>
<p>The minimum detectable activity (MDA) is defined as the minimum
amount of activity in a sample that can be detected with a
5-percent probability of erroneously detecting radioactivity when
none is present, and a 5-percent probability of not detecting
radioactivity when it is present. For any given system designed to
count and quantify radioactivity, the MDA should be calculated for
the most restrictive scenario (i.e., for the nuclide with the
lowest detection efficiency and the most restrictive regulatory
criterion). The units of the MDA (Bq, Bq/gr, Bq/cm<sup>2</sup>)
should be the same as those expressed in the licence or regulatory
criterion, as applicable. The MDA in Bq/cm<sup>2</sup>, can be
calculated as follows:</p>

<p>Where the terms NB, E, A and F have the same meanings as the
section above and</p>
<p>T = the counting time, in seconds, for indirect wipe monitoring,
and is the instrument response time for direct measurements (or the
actual time if performing scalar counting). The instrument response
time will vary between instruments and is a parameter which can be
selected by the user on some devices; e.g., via either software
selection of the actual time or “fast/slow” switch set to
predefined timesspecified in the user manual. Other instruments may
auto-select the response time based on the countrate. Longer
response times will improve the MDA, but the instrument shall stay
stationary over eacharea for a period that is at least as long as
the response time.</p>
<p>Note: the efficiency, and hence the MDA of the instrument is
highly dependent on the distance between the source and the
detector. The MDA should be calculated for the distance at which
the detector will be when monitoring.</p>
<h3>2.10 Selection of contamination monitoring instruments</h3>
<p>The MDA for a nuclear substance will depend on both the types
and energies of radiation emitted by that nuclear substance and on
the type of detector used. In general, there are three basic
detector design considerations that will impact instrument
sensitivity, and each of these parameters will have a different
impact, depending upon the type and energy of radiation being
detected:</p>
<h4>2.10.1 Window thickness and composition</h4>
<p>Consideration should be given to whether the window density is
small enough to allow the radiation emitted by source to enter the
detector. This is critical for low-energy beta radiation and alpha
radiation, which can be completely absorbed even by materials as
thin as a sheet of paper. Note that some isotopes, such as H-3 or
Ni-63, cannot be detected by most instruments, because the beta
radiation they emit gets completely absorbed within the window. For
such isotopes, indirect monitoring using liquid scintillation is
generally the best choice.</p>
<h4>2.10.2 Detector density</h4>
<p>Every radiation detector functions by detecting interactions
between the radiation and a material within the detector. There are
two broad classes of detectors: gas-filled detectors, and solid or
liquid scintillators. Gas-filled detectors, such as Geiger
detectors and proportional counters, will generally work well for
detecting alpha or beta radiation, since these types of radiation
will cause interactions even in low-density materials. Conversely,
gamma rays may readily pass through a low-density gas without
interaction, especially at high energies. Solid scintillators, such
as NaI detectors, are generally much better suited to detecting
gamma radiation. Thin crystal detectors are suitable for low-energy
gamma emitters such as Tc-99m, while thicker detectors will enhance
sensitivity for high-energy gammas such as those from Cs-137 or
Co-60.</p>
<h4>2.10.3 Detector output</h4>
<p>Every time radiation interacts with a detector, a tiny amount of
energy is released within the detector. This energy is then
converted into an electronic signal that can be measured. Some
detectors, such as Geiger counters, produce uniform pulses which
can be counted. Other systems, such as scintillators or
proportional counters, may produce a signal that is proportional to
the amount of energy released in the initial radiation interaction.
This can be used to distinguish between different types of
radiation or different energies of radiation of the same type. Such
detectors are useful in applications where distinguishing between
multiple different isotopes may be necessary.</p>

<p>Ion chambers are another major type of portable detector. These
devices are intended for measurement of radiation dose rates rather
than contamination. In general, they are poorly suited to
contamination monitoring and should not be used for this
purpose.</p>
<p>** Nuclear substances that decay via emission of alpha or beta
particles often also emit gamma rays. Many isotopes, especially
high atomic number materials such as uranium and radium, may exist
in equilibrium with the other isotopes in their “decay chain”,
which in turn emit many different types and energies of<br />
radiation. When choosing a contamination monitor, it is important
to consider exactly what types of radiation will be present. For
example, positron emission tomography (PET) isotopes decay by
the<br />
emission of a positron (beta+) which in turn produces two
high-energy (511 keV) gamma rays. It is the gamma rays that are of
primary importance in the use of these isotopes, and a thick
crystal NaI scintillator will detect these gammas very efficiently.
However, a thin window Geiger detector will detect the beta+
emissions even more efficiently, and will generally have a much
lower background (NB) count-rate.</p>

selection, please see the <a href=

<h3>2.11 Detector efficiency</h3>
<p>The detector efficiency depends upon:<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>the type of detector (ex: Geiger-Müller, NaI scintillation,

counter…)</li>
<li>the detector size and shape</li>

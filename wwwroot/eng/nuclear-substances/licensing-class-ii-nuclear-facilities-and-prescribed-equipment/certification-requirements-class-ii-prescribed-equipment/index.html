<p>Class II prescribed equipment is regulated in accordance with
the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) <a href=
"http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2000-205/index.html">
<em>Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment
Regulations</em></a>, which specify that:</p>
<p>"No person shall use Class II prescribed equipment unless</p>
<ol class="list-lower-alpha">
<li>it is a certified model; or</li>
<li>it is used in accordance with a licence that authorizes its use
for development purposes or for scientific research that is not
conducted on humans."</li>
</ol>
<p>The CNSC requires the certification of Class II prescribed
equipment to ensure that any devices being purchased and installed
are operated in accordance with the <em><a href=
"http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-28.3/index.html">Nuclear
Safety and Control Act</a></em> (NSCA) and the <a href=
"http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2000-205/index.html">
<em>Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment
Regulations</em></a>. CNSC requirements for certification are
independent of other requirements imposed by other federal,
provincial and territorial authorities.</p>
<p>Although vendors of prescribed equipment typically apply for
certification, it is the licensee who is responsible for ensuring
that all devices being used are certified by the CNSC. With some
exceptions, device certification (or recertification) is required
for:</p>
<ul>
<li>introduction of prescribed equipment to the Canadian
market</li>
<li>design change to previously certified equipment</li>
<li>change in model name</li>
<li>packaging or repackaging of individual certified equipment</li>
<li>change in corporate ownership, name or location</li>
<li>rebranded equipment</li>
<li>changes to information previously provided for device
certification</li>
</ul>

"/eng/acts-and-regulations/cost-recovery-program/index.cfm">fees</a>

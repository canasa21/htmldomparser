<title>Certified exposure device operators</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Exposure device operators (EDOs) certified by the CNSC are
required to renew their certification every five years to continue
working as certified EDOs.</p>
<p>The CNSC reserves the right to verify that certified EDOs
maintain the required knowledge and skills to operate exposure
devices safely and securely. The CNSC may take regulatory action –
up to decertification – if a certified EDO is found to be operating
contrary to safety protocols and conditions, or if a certified EDO
is causing undue risk to the public or the environment.</p>
<div class="col-md-12 alert alert-info">
<p>As of January 1, 2017, the CNSC will consider a worker to be
qualified to operate an exposure device <strong>only</strong> if
they have a valid EDO certification card (that is, a card issued on
or after February 1, 2013 that has not expired). As a result, any
EDO whose certification card does not have an expiry date or whose
certification card has expired will not be considered qualified to
work as a certified EDO.</p>
</div>
<p>Valid EDO certification cards show the expiry date of the EDO
certification:</p>

<h2>Expectations for renewal of an EDO certification</h2>
<p>The CSA Group's document <a href=
"https://www.csagroup.org/store-resources/documents/handbooks-and-guides/CEDO_Certification_Guide_PCP-09_March_2015.pdf">
CSA PCP-09</a>, Certified Exposure Device Operator Personnel
Certification Guide is the official guide for CNSC EDO
certification and renewal of certification.</p>
<p>Certified EDOs are expected to maintain their knowledge and
skills to safely operate an exposure device by completing an EDO
practical examination, completing EDO-related continuing education
and working continuously as a certified EDO. To renew your EDO
certification, you are expected to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>successfully completed an EDO practical examination within the
past 12 months that was administered by an authorized examiner (see
a <a href=
"/sites/default/files/FORM-EDO-R-CE-Certified-EDO-Continuing-Education-Log-eng.pdf">
EDO continuing education log</a> [FORM-EDO-R-CE]). You may be asked
to submit this information to the CNSC.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>continuously worked as a certified EDO:</li>
<ul>
<li>at least 320 hours of work as a certified EDO in the previous
two years and no single period of non-work as a certified EDO that
exceeds 12 months in the previous three years<br />
OR</li>
<li>continuous work as a radiation safety officer, supervisor of
certified EDOs, trainer of certified EDOs or an emergency responder
over the previous three years, with any single period of work not
related to certified EDOs not to exceed six months</li>
</ul>
<li>As a certified EDO, you are responsible for maintaining a log
of your EDO-related work experience (see a CNSC sample of a
certified <a href=
"/sites/default/files/FORM-EDO-R-CW-Certified-EDO-Work-Log-eng.pdf">
EDO work log</a> [FORM-EDO-R-CW]). You may be asked to submit your
EDO work log to the CNSC.</li>
</ul>
<p>Certified EDOs who cannot meet these expectations for renewal of
certification may have to complete the EDO written examination. For

<body>
<p>To perform gamma radiography or operate an exposure device in
Canada, the law requires you to be certified by the Canadian
Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) as an exposure device operator
(EDO) or be working under the direct supervision of a certified
EDO.</p>
<div class="col-md-12 alert alert-info">
<p>As of January 1, 2017, the CNSC will consider a worker qualified
to operate an exposure device <strong>only</strong> if they have a
valid EDO certification card (that is, a card issued on or after
February 1, 2013 that has not expired). As a result, any EDO whose
certification card does not have an expiry date or whose
certification card has expired will not be considered qualified to
work as a certified EDO.</p>

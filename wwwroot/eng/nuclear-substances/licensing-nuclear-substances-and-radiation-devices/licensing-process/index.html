<title>Licensing process</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) licensing process
includes a thorough assessment of the application submission and,
if the licence is being renewed, a verification of the licensee’s
compliance performance. All licence applications are assessed based
on the risk-ranking of the proposed licensed use type. Read about
the <a href="#CNSCLicensingandComplianceTools">licensing and
compliance tools that the CNSC uses</a>.</p>
<p>A licence application goes through the following steps within
the CNSC:</p>
<ol>
<li>entry into our electronic records system</li>
<li>assessment for relevant cost-recovery fees, if applicable</li>
<li>entry into our licensing database</li>
<li>technical assessment by a licensing specialist</li>
<li>quality assurance</li>
<li>sign-off by a designated officer (if the application and the
applicant meet all regulatory requirements)</li>
<li>licence issued and mailed/faxed to licensee</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="NewLicenceApplication">New licence application</h2>
<p>In order to obtain a nuclear substances and radiation devices
licence, an application must be submitted to the CNSC. The CNSC
will only issue a licence when the applicant:</p>
<ul>
<li>is deemed qualified to carry on the activity that the licence
will authorize</li>
<li>has demonstrated that they will protect the health and safety
of persons and the environment</li>
<li>has demonstrated that they will maintain national security</li>
<li>has confirmed that they will adhere to international
obligations to which Canada has agreed.</li>
</ul>
<p>To apply for a licence, please consult REGDOC-1.6.1, <em>Licence
Application Guide: Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices,</em>
version 2 (<a href=
"/sites/default/files/REGDOC-1-6-1-Licence-Application-Guide-Nuclear-substances-and-Radiation-Devices-version2-eng.pdf">REGDOC-1.6.1,
version 2 PDF</a>), and fill out the corresponding <a href=

licence application form for nuclear substances and radiation
devices</a>, revision date 2017-05 (PDF).</p>
<p>To view the costs associated with the licensing process, please
refer to the CNSC’s cost recovery program.</p>
<p>If the application received by the CNSC is complete, processing
time could take up to 80 business days. Applicants will be
contacted by the CNSC during the licence application review process
and once a licence is issued.</p>
<h2 id="FinancialGuarantees">Financial guarantees</h2>
<p>All licensees are responsible for safely carrying out the
nuclear activities authorized under their licences, from the
issuance of the licence up to and including safe termination of the
licensed activities. A financial guarantee ensures there are funds
available for the safe termination of licensed activities when the
licensee is unable to carry this out. Licensees are required to
provide a financial guarantee to the CNSC.</p>

<h2>Licence transfer</h2>
<p>Under certain circumstances – as per the <em>Nuclear Safety and
Control Act</em> (NSCA), sections 24(2) and 24(4) – the CNSC may
authorize the transfer of a licence from one licensee to another,
or to a new licence applicant, provided there has been no
significant change in the licensed activity. This process is
intended to simplify the regulatory process for licensees, while
ensuring that all regulatory requirements are met.</p>
<p>A request for licence transfer can be triggered by the following
changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>change to a corporation’s name and number</li>
<li>corporate merger</li>
<li>corporate restructuring</li>
</ul>
<p>To request a licence transfer, the existing licensee must
complete and submit an application form to their CNSC licensing
officer including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a copy of the new proof of legal status</li>
<li>the appropriate applicant authority form, including required
photo identification</li>
<li>the request to appoint a new radiation safety officer (RSO)
form, with associated information, if there has been a change in
RSO or applicant authority</li>

<h2 id="LicenceAmendmentRequests">Licence amendment requests</h2>
<p>During the licence period, certain circumstances may require
changes to the licence, and a request for amendment must be
submitted. An amendment is a modification to an existing licence in
order to change certain information. You are required to request an
amendment if there is any change in your current regulatory program
information, equipment or licensed activities.</p>
<p>When requesting an amendment to an existing nuclear substances
and radiation devices licence, the following details must be
submitted along with the licence number:</p>
<ul>
<li>changes to nuclear substances and/or radiation devices</li>
<li>changes to the location of use and/or storage</li>
<li>changes to personnel (licence contact information i.e., RSO
applicant authority, alternative RSO, etc.)</li>
<li>changes to policies, programs and procedures</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to process a change in corporate name, a copy of a
legal document showing the change, such as certificate of
amendment, certificate of amalgamation or certificate of
incorporation must be submitted to the CNSC with the licence
amendment.</p>
<p>For changes to applicant authorities, the CNSC must be notified
within 15 days in accordance with section 15 of the <a href=

<p>All requests for licence amendments must be made in writing by
the licensee’s designated signing authority. This can be done by
fax (613-995-5086) or by contacting a CNSC licensing specialist at
1-888-229-2672.</p>
<p>Processing an amendment to a licence could take up to three
weeks from the date a completed submission is received.</p>
<h2 id="RevokingaLicence">Revoking a licence</h2>
<p>In order to revoke a licence, proof of decommissioning of the
site or building must be submitted to the CNSC staff before the
site or building can be released from regulatory control. The
licensee must ensure that all nuclear substances and radiation
devices have been removed, and that the contamination levels of the
site or building do not exceed the limits specified on the licence.
Licensees must submit documentation showing that any nuclear
substances and radiation devices formerly in their possession have
been received by another licensee who is authorized to possess
these materials.</p>
<p>In order for an existing CNSC licence to be revoked, a licensee
must submit a <a href=
"/pubs_catalogue/uploads/dispos_e.pdf">request for revocation</a>
(PDF). Once the CNSC determines the information is complete, the
licence will be revoked and a letter confirming the revocation will
be sent to the licensee.</p>
<p>See the <a href=
"/sites/default/files/nuclear-substances-and-radiation-devices-licences-decommissioning-checklist_eng.pdf">
CNSC’s decommissioning checklist (PDF)</a> to ensure you are
following the right steps.</p>
<h2 id="CNSCLicensingandComplianceTools">CNSC licensing and
compliance tools</h2>
<p>CNSC’s Risk Informed Regulatory Program specifies that
activities with the greatest risk profile will receive the greatest
regulatory oversight. The following tools allow the CNSC to monitor
and verify compliance with the <em><a href=
"https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-28.3/index.html">Nuclear
Safety and Control Act</a></em> (NSCA), its regulations and the
licence conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Application assessment (desktop reviews)</strong><br />
The CNSC reviews all information provided in the application to
ensure compliance with the NSCA and the regulations.This stage
includes the review of a new licence application, an amendment
request or a renewal application.</p>
</li>
<li class="mrgn-tp-md"><strong>Annual compliance report
(ACR)</strong><br />
Licensees are required to submit annual reports of the activities
they performed. Examples of items to report in the ACR include:
<ul>
<li>transfers, purchase, disposal of nuclear substances and
radiation devices</li>
<li>dosimetry information</li>
<li>inventory</li>
<li>changes in the radiation protection program</li>
</ul>
<p>Annual compliance reports allow licensees to self-report, and
allow the CNSC to monitor routine compliance indicators. ACR forms
for your usetype can be downloaded for submission.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Type I inspections</strong><br />
Type I inspections (also known as audit) are in-depth examinations
of a licensee’s processes and operations and typically occur at the
licensee’s operational site(s). Compliance verification is done
through direct observations of work activities, a comprehensive
review of procedures and records, and staff interviews. This type
of inspection will include the participation of several CNSC staff
members, who may be onsite for a period of several days. At the end
of the inspection, the licensee is presented with the preliminary
findings, and a complete report is sent to the licensee within 60
days of the inspection. The licensee is given a list of
non-compliances found, and must provide timelines for addressing
these findings. Should something be found during the inspection
that is an imminent threat to health, safety or the environment,
the NSCA provides inspectors with the power to immediately order
cessation of these activities.</li>
<li class="mrgn-tp-md"><strong>Type II inspections</strong><br />
A Type II inspection is an onsite snapshot of the licensee’s
operations. These inspections are typically shorter than Type I,
since extensive interviews are not performed, and data is collected
mainly through direct observations, measurements and reviews of
onsite records. At the end of the inspection, the licensee is
presented with a preliminary report, and a complete report is sent
to the licensee within 30 days of the inspection. The licensee is
given a list of non-compliances found and must provide timelines
for addressing these findings. Should something be found during the
inspection that is an imminent threat to health, safety or the
environment, the NSCA provides inspectors with the power to
immediately order cessation of these activities.</li>

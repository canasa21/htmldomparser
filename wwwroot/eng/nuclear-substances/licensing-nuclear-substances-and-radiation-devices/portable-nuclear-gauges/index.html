<!--div class="alert alert-info"> <h3>Notice of a potential defect in InstroTek 3500 Xplorer portable gauges</h3> <p>Some licensees have reported to the CNSC that InstroTek 3500 Xplorer portable gauges may be subject to a manufacturing defect. When retracted, the source rod may come out of the device if someone simply pulls on the rod. This defect affects only the portable gauges with serial numbers ranging from 3200 to 3289. If you have an InstroTek 3500 Xplorer portable gauge with a serial number in this range, the CNSC advises you to contact the Canadian distributor, Stuart Hunt &amp; Associates Ltd., by email at <a href="mailto:sales@stuarthunt.com">sales@stuarthunt.com</a> or by telephone at 1-800-661-4599. The CNSC also recommends that you stop using the gauge until it has been inspected and/or repaired.</p> </div-->
<p>Gauges are used in industries such as agriculture, construction
and civil engineering to measure moisture and compaction levels in
soil and asphalt density in paving mixes.</p>
<p>To do these measurements, two types of radiation are used in
gauges: gamma (such as cesium-137) and neutron (such as
americium-241/beryllium).</p>
<p>Portable gauge licensees must ensure that doses are kept as low
as reasonably achievable (ALARA). The CNSC facilitates this by
regulating the use of radiation devices, by assessing radiation
protection programs, and by regularly inspecting licensees to
ensure compliance with the regulations and licence conditions.</p>
<p>Portable gauge users must ensure that they safely conduct their
work and comply with all applicable regulatory requirements. Their
safety – as well as the safety of the public and the environment –
depends at all times on a high level of radiation safety.</p>
<p>Gauge users must comply with the radiation protection program
established by their employer, in accordance with regulatory
requirements. Risks that may jeopardize the integrity, safety or
security of gauges, safe operations or radiation detection
instruments have to be duly considered and mitigated.</p>
<p>Each portable gauge must be either under the constant
surveillance of a worker, or secured in a transport vehicle or at
the storage location.</p>

<p>To export risk-significant radioactive sources (IAEA Category 1
and 2, described in Table I below), Canadian exporters must obtain
a transaction-specific export licence.</p>
<p>The issuance of the licence is consistent with the provisions of
the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) <a href=
"http://www-ns.iaea.org/tech-areas/radiation-safety/code-of-conduct.htm">
<em>Code of Conduct</em> <em>on the Safety and Security of
Radioactive Sources</em></a> (the Code) and its supplementary
<a href=
"http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Imp-Exp_web.pdf"><em>
Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive Sources</em></a>
(the Guidance) for import and export controls for risk-significant
radioactive sources.</p>
<p>Licence applications to export Category 1 radioactive sources
from Canada are subject to prior consent by the importing state
authority.</p>

<h3>Licence transfer</h3>
<p>Under certain circumstances – as per the Nuclear Safety and
Control Act (NSCA), sections 24(2) and 24(4) – the CNSC may
authorize the transfer of a licence from one licensee to another,
or to a new licence applicant, provided there has been no
significant change in the licensed activity. This process is
intended to simplify the regulatory process for licensees, while
ensuring that all regulatory requirements are met.</p>
<p>A request for licence transfer can be triggered by the following
changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>change to a corporation’s name and number</li>
<li>corporate merger</li>
<li>corporate restructuring</li>
</ul>
<p>To request a licence transfer, the existing licensee must
complete and submit an application form.</p>

<h2>Import controls</h2>
<p>A separate, specific licence to import risk-significant
radioactive sources is not required, provided that the Canadian
licensee has general authorization to import and possess such
sources (under a licence to possess and use).</p>
<p>Risk-significant radioactive sources cannot be imported without
this general authorization.</p>
<p>All imports of Category 1 radioactive sources into Canada are
subject to the CNSC's consent prior to import.</p>
<p>All imports of Category 1 and 2 radioactive sources also require
prior shipment notifications (to be issued by the exporting
facility or the exporting state authority).</p>
<h2 id="sec3">Instructions for completing an application for a
licence to export risk-significant radioactive sources</h2>
<p>The following instructions provide guidance on submitting
appropriate information to accompany an application to export
risk-significant radioactive sources:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#secB-1">Important notes</a></li>
<li><a href="#secB-2">Overview of the application form</a></li>
<li><a href="#secB-3">Application form</a></li>
<li><a href="#secB-4">Supplemental information</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="secB-1">Important notes</h3>
<ol class="list-lower-alpha">
<li>Complete, sign and print the application form. Email, fax or
mail the document to the CNSC address listed at the bottom of the
form.</li>
<li>All mandatory information must be provided. Additional
information may be submitted on a separate sheet. Incomplete
applications cannot be processed and may result in delays. The CNSC
may request additional information or documents.</li>
<li>The period to review an application is typically 30 business
days upon receipt. For more details refer to “Processing time”
below.</li>
<li>Upon approval of the application, a licence to export
risk-significant radioactive sources will be issued and sent by
email to the applicant.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Processing time</h3>
<p>A CNSC decision on an export licence application will generally
depend, in part, on the scope of international communications and
consultations required. The length of time for completing these
will depend on a variety of factors, such as the state of the
importing country’s regulatory import/export control program, the
availability of information about the importer, and whether the
export item is a Category 1 or Category 2 source. In some cases,
additional time may be required to process an export licence
application. Applicants are encouraged to apply for an export
licence at the earliest opportunity.</p>

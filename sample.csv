Compliance activities include facility inspections, application requests, review of licensee reports, and  environmental, radiation and conventional health and safety data analysis. </p>    <p>CNSC certified inspectors conduct regular  inspections at operating and decommissioned facilities. These inspections are  shared with employees at the facility, the <a href="http://www.saskatchewan.ca/residents/first-nations-citizens/saskatchewan-first-nations-metis-and-northern-initiatives/northern-saskatchewan-environmental-quality-committee">Northern Saskatchewan Environmental Quality Committee</a> and other regulators. Inspections are conducted with other regulatory agencies, such as the provincial or territorial departments of Environment and Labour, and representatives from other federal government departments (for example, Environment Canada and Fisheries and Oceans).</p>    <p>An example of an area the CNSC regulates is <a href="/eng/resources/fact-sheets/radon.cfm">radon</a> exposure in uranium mines and mills. The CNSC requires licensees have engineering design and control processes to remove radon to limit exposure to workers. Radon is naturally produced by the decay of uranium and is released into the air when uranium ore is mined and milled. Radon gas produced during mining and milling is continuously monitored, controlled, and safely ventilated away from the workers. Presently, worker exposures to radon in the uranium mining and processing industry are as low as, or only slightly greater than, public exposure from natural radon.</p>    <div class="module-poster span-2 float-right"> <img src="/images/uranium-mines-and-miles/Figure-2-CNSC-and-Saskatchewan-Ministry-Environment-inspectors.jpg" alt="" />      <div class="image-caption">        <p>CNSC and Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment inspectors assessing a concrete containment structure</p>      </div>    </div>    <p>Licensees are required to notify the CNSC of significant events or situations outside the normal operations described in their licensing documents or due to public interest.

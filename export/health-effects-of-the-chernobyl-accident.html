  <title>Health Effects of the Chernobyl Accident</title>

  <h2>Quick facts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The 1986 accident at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine
    was the largest uncontrolled radioactive release in
    history.</li>
    <li>The initial steam explosion resulted in the deaths of two
    workers. 134 plant staff and emergency workers suffered acute
    radiation syndrome (ARS) due to high doses of radiation; of
    those, 28 of them later died from ARS.</li>
    <li>The total number of cases of thyroid cancer registered in
    the 1991–2015 period among those under 18 years of age in 1986
    (for the whole of Belarus and Ukraine, and for the four
    most-contaminated oblasts of the Russian Federation),
    approached 20,000.
      <ul>
        <li>About 5,000 thyroid cancer cases were attributable to
        radioactive iodine (iodine-131) exposure to those who were
        children or adolescents at the time of the accident.</li>
        <li>The remaining 15,000 cases are due to a variety of
        factors, such as increased spontaneous incidence rate with
        aging of the population, awareness of thyroid cancer risk
        after the accident, and improved diagnostic methods to
        detect thyroid cancer.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>There were no other demonstrated increases in the rates of
    solid cancers, leukemia and non-cancerous diseases from the
    radiation exposure.</li>
    <li>In the three most-affected countries – Belarus, the Russian
    Federation and Ukraine – radiation doses to the general public
    were relatively low.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The 1986 accident at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine
  was the largest uncontrolled radioactive release in history.</p>
  <p>On April 26, 1986, steam and hydrogen explosions at the
  Chernobyl plant's Unit 4 led to a rupture in the reactor vessel
  and a fire that lasted 10 days. The explosions and fire caused
  the release of large amounts of radioactive iodine and cesium
  into the air, mostly near the plant; the wind carried some
  material over Belarus, the Russian Federation, Ukraine and other
  parts of Europe.</p>
  <p>The following summarizes the health assessments published in
  the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic
  Radiation (UNSCEAR) 2008 Report titled <a href=
  "http://www.unscear.org/unscear/en/chernobyl.html"><em>Health
  effects due to radiation from the Chernobyl accident</em></a> and
  the UNSCEAR 2018 White Paper titled <a href=
  "http://www.unscear.org/unscear/en/publications.html"><em>Evaluation
  of data on thyroid cancer in regions affected by the Chernobyl
  accident</em></a>. The findings in these reports are based on
  approximately 30 years of studies of the health consequences of
  radiation exposure from the Chernobyl accident. UNSCEAR
  acknowledges that thyroid cancer after the Chernobyl accident is
  a major issue and that further investigation is needed to
  determine the long-term consequences.</p>

  <h2>Radiation released during the Chernobyl accident</h2>
  <p>Workers and the public were exposed to three main types of
  radionuclides: iodine-131, cesium-134 and cesium-137.</p>
  <p>When iodine-131 is released into the environment, it is
  quickly transferred to humans and taken up by the thyroid gland.
  However, I-131 has a short half-life (8 days). Children exposed
  to radioactive iodine usually receive higher doses than adults,
  because their thyroid gland is smaller and they have a higher
  metabolism.</p>
  <p>Cesium isotopes have longer half-lives (approximately 2 years
  for cesium-134 and 30 years for cesium-137), increasing the
  chance of long-term exposure through ingestion of contaminated
  food and water, inhalation of contaminated air, or from
  radionuclides deposited in soil.</p>
  <h3>Worker health impacts</h3>
  <p>On the day of the accident, there were 600 workers onsite. 134
  suffered acute radiation sickness, 28 of whom died in the first
  three months. For those who survived radiation sickness, recovery
  took several years.</p>
  <p>Among the 600 workers onsite, increased incidences of leukemia
  and cataracts were recorded for those exposed to higher doses of
  radiation; otherwise, there has been no increase in the incidence
  of solid cancers or leukemia among the rest of the exposed
  workers. There is no evidence of increases in other non-cancerous
  diseases from ionizing radiation.</p>
  <p>The 530,000 registered recovery operation workers who worked
  at the accident site between 1986 and 1990 were exposed to doses
  ranging from 20 to 500 mSv (averaging 120 mSv). This cohort's
  health is still being closely followed.</p>

  </div>
  <h3>Public health impacts</h3>
  <p>The 115,000 members of the public who had to be evacuated from
  the area around the plant received an average effective radiation
  dose of 30 mSv. Radiation doses to the general public in the
  three contaminated countries (Belarus, the Russian Federation and
  Ukraine) were relatively low, with an average effective dose of 9
  mSv, about the dose of a medical CT scan (i.e., 10 mSv). The
  total worldwide average effective dose from natural background
  radiation is around 2.4 mSv per year. In Canada, it is 1.8 mSv
  per year.</p>
  <p>Among the residents of Belarus, the Russian Federation and
  Ukraine, as of 2015 there had been almost 20,000 cases of thyroid
  cancer reported in children and adolescents who were exposed at
  the time of the accident. Approximately 5,000 of these thyroid
  cancers are likely attributable to children drinking fresh milk
  containing radioactive iodine from cows who had eaten
  contaminated grass in the first few weeks following the accident.
  The remaining 15,000 cases are due to a variety of factors, such
  as increased spontaneous incidence rate with aging of the
  population, awareness of thyroid cancer risk after the accident,
  and improved diagnostic methods to detect thyroid cancer.</p>
  <p>The radiation dose due to Chernobyl in other European
  countries was less than 1 mSv. In more distant countries,
  radiation from the accident had no impact on the annual
  background doses and was considered to be non-significant to
  public health.</p>

  </div>
  <h3>Psychological or mental health problems</h3>
  <p>According to several international studies, people exposed to
  radiation from Chernobyl have high anxiety levels and are more
  likely to report unexplained physical symptoms and poor
  health.</p>
  <h3>Concerns about fertility and birth defects</h3>
  <p>There is no evidence of decreased fertility in men or women in
  the affected regions. Because doses to the general population
  were low, it is unlikely that there would be any increase in
  stillbirths, adverse pregnancy outcomes, delivery complications,
  or negative impacts on children's overall health. Regardless,
  monitoring remains important and is ongoing.</p>

  <p>The UNSCEAR 2008 report on Chernobyl confirmed that, while new
  research data has become available, the major conclusions about
  the 1986 Chernobyl accident's health consequences are essentially
  consistent with previous assessments. The UNSCEAR 2018 White
  Paper acknowledges that thyroid cancer is the major health issue
  (in individuals who were children or adolescents at the time of
  the accident) and that further investigation is needed to
  determine the long-term consequences of radiation exposure. The
  previous fear of an increase in leukemia rates has not
  materialized, nor have any fertility problems arisen. As previous
  assessments indicate, psychological effects – such as high
  anxiety – and general poor health were observed. Previous studies
  have shown that there were no global consequences of the accident
  in Asia and North America, which remains true today.</p>

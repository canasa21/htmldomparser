  <p>Historic low-level waste consists of soil contaminated with
  uranium and radium, at sites located in the Northwest
  Territories, British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario.</p>
  <p>This waste was originally managed in a way that is no longer
  considered acceptable, but for which the current owner cannot be
  reasonably held responsible.</p>
  <p>The government of Canada has accepted responsibility for the
  long-term management of this waste, which is currently managed by
  the <a href=
  "http://www.cnl.ca/en/home/environmental-stewardship/national-programs.aspx">
  Historic Waste Program Management Office</a>, run by Canadian
  Nuclear Laboratories Ltd. (CNL).</p>

  <p>Radioactive waste has been produced in Canada since the early
  1930s, when the first radium and uranium mine began operating at
  Port Radium, Northwest Territories.</p>
  <p>Pitchblende ore was transported from the Northwest Territories
  through the Northern Transportation Route to Port Hope,
  Ontario.</p>
  <p>The ore was refined to produce radium for medical purposes.
  Later on, the uranium was destined for nuclear fuel and military
  applications.</p>
  <h2 id="Port">Port Hope and Clarington</h2>
  <p>The bulk of Canada's historic waste is located in the Ontario
  communities of <a href=
  "/eng/uranium/processing/nuclear-facilities/port-hope-uranium-conversion/index.cfm">
  Port Hope and Clarington</a>.</p>
  <p>This waste and contaminated soils amount to roughly 2 million
  cubic metres, and relate to the historic operations of a radium
  and uranium refinery in the municipality of Port Hope, dating
  back to the 1930s.</p>

  <p>While the low-level radioactivity of naturally occurring
  radioactive materials do not pose a risk to human health and the
  environment, there is general consensus in the local community,
  as well as in professional and regulatory communities, that the
  management of the waste onsite does not represent a suitable
  long-term solution.</p>
  <p>In March 2001, the Government of Canada and the local
  municipalities agreed to community-developed proposals as
  potential solutions for the cleanup and long-term management of
  this low-level radioactive waste, launching the <a href=
  "/eng/waste/historic-nuclear-waste/port-hope-area-initiative/index.cfm">
  Port Hope Area Initiative</a>.</p>
  <p>Historic low-level radioactive waste is present within the
  Ontario municipalities of Port Hope and Clarington. The waste,
  which is no longer produced, resulted from radium and uranium
  refining by a former federal Crown corporation (Eldorado Nuclear)
  and its private-sector predecessors from the 1930s to 1980s. The
  <a href=
  "http://www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/waste/historic-nuclear-waste/port-hope-area-initiative/index.cfm">
  Port Hope Area Initiative (PHAI)</a>, a community-initiated
  environmental remediation, is currently underway and will ensure
  the cleanup and safe long-term management of historic low-level
  waste within these municipalities.</p>
  <p>Through its Historic Waste Program Management Office, <a href=
  "http://www.cnl.ca/en/home/environmental-stewardship/phai.aspx#_blank">
  Canadian Nuclear Laboratories</a> (CNL) is implementing the PHAI
  on behalf of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, a federal Crown
  corporation. CNL is responsible for both of the PHAI projects –
  the Port Hope Project in the Municipality of Port Hope, and the
  Port Granby Project in the Municipality of Clarington. CNL is
  currently licensed by the CNSC to operate existing waste
  management facilities in Port Hope (Welcome Waste Management
  Facility) and in Clarington (Port Granby Waste Management
  Facility), which are being replaced with new, advanced technology
  facilities as part of the PHAI.</p>
  <p>CNL currently supports the PHAI MO through its interim waste
  management program, and will continue to do so until waste
  management activities are completed. CNL currently operates the
  Pine Street Extension Temporary Storage Site, which is a
  low-level radioactive waste management facility licensed to
  receive historic radioactive waste from construction activities
  within the municipality. The waste at this site will eventually
  be transferred into the new Long-Term Waste Management Facility
  that is being constructed for the Port Hope Project.</p>
  <h2 id="Toronto">Toronto area</h2>
  <p>The low-level contamination in the Toronto area comes from
  production of radioluminescent dials.</p>
  <p>Contaminated sites include radium-contaminated soils on lands
  owned by the province of Ontario and private landowners, as well
  as radium contamination of structural elements in privately owned
  buildings.</p>
  <p>The contaminated soils are generally covered or occur in areas
  of low use (primarily open space).</p>
  <p>The owners of the private properties are aware of these
  control measures, and the tenants are restricted from
  construction activities that would compromise these
  safeguards.</p>
  <p>The owners are also aware that they are required to contact
  the CNSC to assess any proposed construction or land-use
  changes.</p>
  <p>The CNSC maintains contact with the owners/managers of the
  sites through visits and phone conversations and conducts site
  visits once every three years.</p>

  <h2 id="Northern">Northern sites</h2>
  <p>From the early 1930s to the 1950s, uranium ore was transported
  over 2,200 km by the Northern Transportation Route (NTR) from
  Port Radium (on Great Bear Lake, Northwest Territories) to the
  railhead at Waterways (now Fort McMurray, Alberta).</p>
  <p>In the 1990s, AECL’s Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management
  Office (LLRWMO) identified sites impacted by uranium ore along
  the NTR. The contamination was located primarily in docks and
  boat launches.</p>
  <p>Radiological surveys conducted in 2004, 2005 and 2006
  determined the volume of the waste to be approximately 10,000
  cubic metres. Following these surveys the LLRWMO removed and
  consolidated most of the higher-density, uranium-impacted soil
  from the identified locations.</p>
  <p>CNL is in charge of continuing to address the historic nuclear
  waste in Canada's north.</p>
  <p>It is adapting methods of community engagement and technical
  approaches that have led to successful remediation projects in
  Canada's southern regions.</p>

  <title>Naturally occurring radioactive material</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Naturally occurring radiative material (NORM) is material
  found in the environment that contains radioactive elements of
  natural origin. NORM primarily contains uranium and thorium
  (elements that also release radium and radon gas once they begin
  to decay) and potassium. These elements are naturally decaying
  and are considered a primary contributor to an individual's
  yearly background radiation dose.</p>

  <h2>Where can NORM be found?</h2>
  <p>NORM is often found in its natural state in rocks or sand. It
  can also be associated with oil and gas production residue (such
  as mineral scale in pipes, sludge and contaminated equipment),
  coal ash (produced from burning coal for energy production) and
  on filter media (such as the used filters from municipal drinking
  water treatment equipment). NORM can also be present in consumer
  products, including common building products (like brick and
  cement blocks), granite counter tops, glazed tiles, phosphate
  fertilizers and tobacco products.</p>
  <p>Some industries may regularly come into contact with NORM –
  for instance, those engaged in the production of oil and gas,
  phosphate fertilizers, forest products and thermal electricity;
  mineral extraction and processing; tunneling and underground
  workings; metal recycling; waste management; and water
  treatment.</p>

    <h3>Did you know?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>NORM is material naturally found in the environment that
      contains radioactive elements.</li>
      <li>The handling and disposal of NORM within Canada is
      regulated by the provincial and territorial governments.</li>
      <li>The transport, import and export of NORM must follow
      Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) regulations.</li>
      <li>NORM-contaminated equipment and waste should only be
      handled by a person with appropriate radiation training.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>How is NORM regulated?</h2>
  <p>In Canada, NORM is regulated by the provincial and territorial
  governments, each having its own specific regulations on the
  handling and disposal of the material. The <a href=
  "https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/publications/health-risks-safety/canadian-guidelines-management-naturally-occurring-radioactive-materials.html">
  Canadian Guidelines for the Management of Naturally Occurring
  Radioactive Materials</a> have been developed by the Federal
  Provincial Territorial Radiation Protection Committee (FPtrPC) to
  harmonize standards throughout the country and ensure appropriate
  control over NORM; however, provincial regulations should also be
  consulted.</p>
  <p>NORM is exempt from the application of the <a href=
  "http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-28.3/index.html"><em>Nuclear
  Safety and Control Act</em></a> and its regulations except under
  the following circumstances:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>when NORM is associated with the development, production or
    use of nuclear energy as set out in the <em><a href=
    "http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2000-202/page-1.html">
    General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations</a></em></li>
    <li>when NORM is imported into Canada or exported from Canada
    as set out in the <em><a href=
    "http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2000-210/page-1.html">
    Nuclear Non-proliferation Import and Export Control
    Regulations</a></em></li>
    <li>the transport of NORM when the specific activity is greater
    than 70 Bq/g (70 kBq/kg) as set out in the <em><a href=
    "http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2000-208/index.html">

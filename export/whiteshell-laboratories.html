  <p>Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) established the
  Whiteshell Laboratories complex for nuclear research during the
  early 1960s. A major focus of the program at Whiteshell was the
  WR-1 organically cooled research reactor, which was shut down in
  1985. The reactor is partially decommissioned and in safe storage
  awaiting final decommissioning. The facilities are currently
  being decommissioned by Canadian Nuclear Laboratories Ltd.</p>

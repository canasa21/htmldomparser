A major focus of the program at Whiteshell was the WR-1 organically cooled research reactor, which was shut down in 1985. The reactor is partially decommissioned and in safe storage awaiting final decommissioning. The facilities are currently being decommissioned by Canadian Nuclear Laboratories Ltd.</p> <ul> <li><a href="#info">Facility information</a></li> <li><a href="#updates">Latest facility-specific updates</a></li> <li><a href="#proto">Disclosure protocol</a></li> <li><a href="/eng/reactors/research-reactors/other-reactor-facilities/whiteshell-decommissioning.cfm"><em>In situ</em> decommissioning of Whiteshell Reactor #1</a></li> <li><a href="/eng/reactors/research-reactors/other-reactor-facilities/whiteshell-decommissioning.cfm">Environmental assessment of the proposed <em>in situ</em> decommissioning of Whiteshell Reactor #1 project</a></li> </ul> <h2 id="info">Facility Information</h2> <p><strong>Location:</strong> Whiteshell Laboratories is located approximately 10 km west of Pinawa and 100 km northeast of Winnipeg, on the east bank of the Winnipeg River.<br /> <strong>Licensee:</strong> Canadian Nuclear Laboratories Ltd.

    <h2>Quick facts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Smoke detectors can be disposed of in household
      garbage.</li>
      <li>Smoke detectors do not pose any health risk.</li>
      <li>The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) licenses
      the manufacturing and initial distribution of smoke detectors
      in Canada.</li>
      <li>Smoke detectors must comply with standards that involve
      approximately 100 individual tests</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p>Household smoke detectors, also referred to as ionization
  chamber smoke detectors, use radioactive material to sense smoke
  in the air and warn of fire hazards. The radiation source in
  these smoke detectors is usually a small amount of americium-241
  that does not pose a risk to the user of the smoke detector.</p>
  <h2>How do ionization chamber smoke detectors work?</h2>
  <p>The americium-241 in ionization chamber smoke detectors makes
  the air in the detector’s sensing chamber conduct electricity.
  When smoke enters the sensing chamber, it interrupts the
  electrical current, triggering the smoke detector’s alarm.</p>
  <h2>Why are ionization chamber smoke detectors used in
  Canada?</h2>
  <p>Ionizing smoke detectors are best at detecting quick burning
  fires, such as many of the fires which occur in North American
  buildings, which contain significant amounts of wood.</p>
  <h2>Is the radiation from ionization chamber smoke detectors
  dangerous?</h2>
  <p>The radiation source in ionization chamber smoke detectors is
  located between metal foils, which keep the radioactive material
  well contained.</p>
  <p>The tiny amount of radiation that can be measured outside the
  unit does not pose any health risk. In fact, the average annual
  radiation dose a person receives from a smoke detector is 0.01
  percent of the dose they receive from natural background
  radiation.</p>
  <h2>How do I dispose of my household smoke detector?</h2>
  <div class="col-md-3 pull-right"><img src=
  "./images/smoke-detector-a.jpg" alt="Smoke detector" class=
  "image-actual"></div>
  <p>Consumers have three options when their ionizing smoke
  detector reaches its end of useful life:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>participating in municipal recycling programs for these
    devices</li>
    <li>contacting and returning their smoke detector to its
    manufacturer for disposal</li>
    <li>disposing household smoke detectors in regular municipal
    household garbage but not in recycling or composting waste,
    after the removal of its internal battery for proper
    disposal</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>What if I have multiple detectors to dispose of?</h2>
  <p>There is no limit on the total number of smoke detectors that
  can be disposed of at one time.</p>
  <h2>What is the role of the CNSC?</h2>
  <div class="col-md-3 pull-right"><img src=
  "./images/smoke-detector-b.jpg" alt="Smoke detector" class=
  "image-actual"></div>
  <p>The CNSC licenses the manufacturing and initial distribution
  of ionization chamber smoke detectors in Canada. All smoke
  detectors containing a radioactive source sold within Canada are
  approved on a model-by-model basis and must meet the radiation
  safety standards before being distributed.</p>

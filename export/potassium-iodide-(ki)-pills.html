    <h2 class="font-xxlarge">Quick facts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Potassium iodide (KI) is a salt of non-radioactive
      iodine.</li>
      <li>KI only protects the thyroid gland from radioactive
      iodine; it is not effective against any other nuclear
      substance.</li>
      <li>Do not take KI pills unless you are instructed to do so
      by public health officials.</li>
      <li>During a nuclear emergency, you will be promptly notified
      by radio, television, Internet, sirens, automated phone calls
      and social media.</li>
      <li>KI saturates your thyroid gland, preventing radioactive
      iodine from being absorbed; over time, the radioactive iodine
      will decay and be harmlessly excreted in urine.</li>
      <li>The overall benefit of taking KI during an emergency
      outweighs the risk of side effects.</li>
      <li>KI pills are effective for up to 12 years if they are
      stored in a dry location between 15 and 30 degrees
      Celsius.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h2>What to do in the unlikely event of a nuclear emergency</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Go inside and turn on your radio and/or television for
    instructions</li>
    <li>Listen to media reports</li>
    <li>Follow instructions provided by government officials</li>
    <li>Follow the proper steps for evacuation, shelter-in-place,
    taking KI, and reporting to a reception centre for evaluation
    and/or monitoring.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="">
    <h2>What is KI?</h2>
    <p>Potassium iodide (KI) can be used to protect the thyroid
    gland from radioactive iodine that may be released into the air
    in the unlikely event of a radiological emergency. In very
    small quantities, it is an essential nutrient for your thyroid
    gland to function properly. In the event of a nuclear
    emergency, KI is effective in reducing the threat of thyroid
    cancer to residents at risk of inhaling or ingesting
    radioactive iodine. It comes in easy to swallow tablet
    form.</p>
    <p>KI only protects the thyroid gland from radioactive iodine;
    it is not effective against any other nuclear substance.
    Depending on the nature of the emergency, KI is a protective
    measure that can be used in isolation or in combination with
    other protective measures (i.e., evacuation,
    shelter-in-place)</p>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>The thyroid gland will absorb iodine that is in a person's
    bloodstream; it cannot tell the difference between radioactive
    iodine and non-radioactive (stable) iodine. The absorption of
    radioactive iodine can be prevented by taking KI before or soon
    after its release into the air. Taking KI will saturate the
    thyroid gland so that there is no space left for the
    radioactive iodine to be absorbed. Over time, the radioactive
    iodine will undergo radioactive decay and be harmlessly
    excreted in urine.</p>
    <h2>When should it be taken?</h2>
    <p>Not all radiological emergencies involve radioactive iodine,
    and KI is only required when there are significant amounts of
    radioactive iodine present. <strong>KI should only be taken
    when directed by public health officials.</strong> It works
    best when it is taken immediately before or as soon as possible
    after exposure.</p>
    <h2>Are there side effects?</h2>
    <p>The risk of health side effects associated with taking KI is
    very low for all age groups with regular thyroid function. For
    people who have thyroid disorders (e.g., Graves' disease,
    iodine deficiency/sensitivity and auto-immune thyroiditis),
    there is an increased risk of side effects. People who face an
    increased risk of side effects should consult a doctor or nurse
    prior to taking KI. Overall, the benefit of taking the pill
    during a nuclear emergency far outweighs the risk of side
    effects.&nbsp;</p>

  <h2>KI distribution regulations in Canada</h2>
  <p>In Canada, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) has
  recently established a national standard for KI pill
  distribution. Nuclear power plant licensees are required to
  ensure that KI pills are pre-distributed to individuals living or
  working near a nuclear power plant. The Province of Ontario's
  Office of the Fire Marshal & Emergency Management (OFMEM) and the
  New Brunswick Emergency Management Organization (NBEMO) are
  working towards developing a strategy to fulfill these
  requirements.</p>

        municipality to detail in their plans their means of
        facilitating KI pill availability.&nbsp; It also requires
        the nuclear operator, Ontario Power Generation, Bruce Power
        and the Canadian Nuclear Laboratories (except for
        Amherstburg), to provide resources to their
        municipalities.</p>

          <li>For primary zones (within 10 km): strategy adopted is
          to pre-distribute 2 doses per person per day for a
          maximum of 2 days.</li>
          <li>For secondary zones (10 to 50 km): strategy adopted
          is to stock enough doses for “sensitive” populations

        pills have been provided to all residences within 20 km of

        (LPZ). This has now been extended to schools (Fundy Shores
        and Pennfield elementary schools). Residents receive an
        information pamphlet on KI pills that is distributed door
        to door. In addition to residences, there are several KI
        stockpile locations within 50 km of the nuclear generating
        station.</p>

        After evaluating radiological risk, <strong>Gentilly-2 no
        longer represents a risk to surrounding
        populations</strong>, following decommissioning projects
        that have taken place since 2013. This means that
        <strong>KI pills are not a requirement</strong>. In fact,
        previously eligible citizens are now encouraged to dispose
        of the KI pills that they have in stock.</p>

  <p>In Canada, Class II nuclear facilities and prescribed
  equipment are regulated in accordance with the <a href=
  "http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2000-205/FullText.html">
  <em>Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment
  Regulations</em></a> under the <a href=
  "http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-28.3/"><em>Nuclear
  Safety and Control Act</em></a> (NSCA). All Class II prescribed
  equipment must be certified by the CNSC before any of these
  devices can be used in Canada. A general overview of Class II
  nuclear facilities and prescribed equipment follows. More
  detailed information on licensing, compliance and certification
  of Class II prescribed equipment and nuclear facilities can be
  found by choosing one of the options on the left-hand menu.</p>

  <p>A Class II nuclear facility includes the prescribed equipment
  as well as the building (or parts of the building) housing the
  equipment and any ancillary equipment needed for operation. The
  entire facility will be considered during the licensing process
  and activities to evaluate with requirements.</p>

  <h3 id="Licensing">Licensing</h3>
  <p>In Canada, activities relating to Class II facilities must be
  licensed by the CNSC. This includes construction, operation and
  decommissioning.</p>
  <p>The servicing of prescribed equipment is also a licensed
  activity in Canada. Servicing is defined as any maintenance of
  the equipment, including installation, repair or dismantling,
  other than routine operation procedures as indicated in the
  manufacturer's operating manual for the equipment, or as
  authorized in the licence issued for possession or use of the
  equipment. If you wish to perform servicing activities in Canada,
  you must obtain the proper licence to service from the CNSC.</p>

  licensed Class II nuclear facilities and prescribed
  equipment</a>.</p>
  <h3 id="RadiationSafetyOfficers">Radiation safety officers</h3>
  <p>All licensees that operate Class II nuclear facilities or that
  service Class II prescribed equipment must have a certified
  radiation safety officer (RSO) and also designate, in writing, a
  qualified temporary replacement. The person occupying the
  position of RSO is responsible for ensuring that licensed
  activities are conducted safely and that all regulatory
  expectations are met.</p>
  <p>There are two components to the certification process:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>assessment of the candidate’s qualifications to perform the
    duties of the position, based on the submitted application</li>
    <li>assessment of the candidate’s knowledge, based on an
    examination</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If the candidate is able to clearfixly demonstrate to the CNSC
  their knowledge, as it relates to the RSO position within their
  organization, <a href="/eng/the-commission/index.cfm">the
  Commission</a> or a designated officer authorized by the
  Commission will certify the candidate in the position of RSO. The
  process for certification of Class II RSOs, along with guidance
  for applicants, is outlined in <a href=
  "/eng/acts-and-regulations/regulatory-documents/published/html/regdoc2-2-3/index.cfm">
  REGDOC-2.2.3, <em>Personnel Certification</em>.</a></p>
  <p>For more information on the certification of radiation safety
  officers, <a href="/eng/contact-us/index.cfm#general">contact the
  CNSC</a> or your CNSC project officer.</p>
  <h3 id="ComplianceActivities">Compliance activities</h3>
  <p>The CNSC has a number of tools at its disposal to ensure that
  licensees are in compliance with the Act, regulations, and their
  licence conditions. Read more about <a href=

  <h3 id="financial">Financial guarantees</h3>
  <p>All licensees are responsible for safely carrying out the
  nuclear activities authorized under their licences, from the
  issuance of the licence up to and including safe termination of
  the licensed activities. A financial guarantee ensures there are
  funds available for the safe termination of licensed activities
  if the licensee is unable to carry this out. Since 2015,
  licensees possessing &gt; 50&nbsp;MBq of most nuclear substances
  and/or operating certain Class II prescribed equipment are
  required to provide a financial guarantee to the CNSC.</p>

  <p>We believe that there's more to life than a career, no matter
  how satisfying that career is. Balanced, rewarded and recognized
  employees are happier and more productive, which creates a work
  environment that they can enjoy.</p>
  <p>We asked current employees what they love about the CNSC:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Great work–life balance</li>
    <li>Excellent compensation and benefits</li>
    <li>Opportunities for learning, movement and advancement</li>
    <li>Ability to make a difference in a small organization</li>
    <li>Open and transparent management practices</li>
    <li>Fun social events</li>
    <li>Fantastic colleagues</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These are the things that are important to our employees. We
  think that they may be important to you, too.</p>

  <h3>Work–life balance</h3>
  <p>CNSC employees do important and challenging work, but they
  also have time to enjoy their personal lives. We offer a variety
  of flexible work arrangements such as flexible working hours,
  working from home, leave with income averaging, and the ability
  to accumulate and use banked time.</p>
  <p>We also hold social activities throughout the year to bring
  fun into the workplace, and to get to know our colleagues and
  management better. You can expect holiday parties, team-building
  activities, and the opportunity to participate in a variety of
  summer and winter activities. The majority of our events donate
  proceeds to the Government of Canada Workplace Charitable
  Campaign – so you can have fun, and feel good about it too!</p>
  <h2 id="sec2">Learning</h2>
  <div class="col-md-3 pull-right">
    <div class="module-poster">
      <img src="./images/career-learning.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>Continuous learning is encouraged and supported because we
      invest in our employees.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h3>Lifelong learning</h3>
  <p>We believe that learning should be a career-long process. We
  see it as a partnership: employees are responsible for their own
  development, managers enable career development, and the
  organization offers excellent learning opportunities. This
  partnership makes our operations more effective, and our
  workforce more qualified and agile.</p>
  <p>All of our employees work with their manager to complete an
  Individual Learning Plan (ILP), which ensures that continuous
  learning and development is present at all stages of their
  careers.</p>
  <h3>Our program</h3>
  <p>Our learning program spans the full range of learning
  activities – not just in-class sessions. First and foremost, we
  prioritize on-the-job learning. Employees are encouraged to learn
  in their current role, diversify their work experience with
  assignments or micro-missions within the CNSC, or take advantage
  of interchange opportunities. We are also strong believers in
  learning through self-directed research, networking and
  coaching.</p><svg version="1.1" id="Layer_1" xmlns=

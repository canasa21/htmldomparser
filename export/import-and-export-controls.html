    <p>To export risk-significant radioactive sources (IAEA
    Category 1 and 2, described in Table I below), Canadian
    exporters must obtain a transaction-specific export
    licence.</p>
    <p>The issuance of the licence is consistent with the
    provisions of the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA)
    <a href=
    "http://www-ns.iaea.org/tech-areas/radiation-safety/code-of-conduct.htm">

    <h3>Licence transfer</h3>
    <p>Under certain circumstances – as per the Nuclear Safety and
    Control Act (NSCA), sections 24(2) and 24(4) – the CNSC may
    authorize the transfer of a licence from one licensee to
    another, or to a new licence applicant, provided there has been
    no significant change in the licensed activity. This process is
    intended to simplify the regulatory process for licensees,
    while ensuring that all regulatory requirements are met.</p>
    <p>A request for licence transfer can be triggered by the
    following changes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>change to a corporation’s name and number</li>
      <li>corporate merger</li>
      <li>corporate restructuring</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To request a licence transfer, the existing licensee must
    complete and submit an application form.</p>

    <h2>Import controls</h2>
    <p>A separate, specific licence to import risk-significant
    radioactive sources is not required, provided that the Canadian
    licensee has general authorization to import and possess such
    sources (under a licence to possess and use).</p>
    <p>Risk-significant radioactive sources cannot be imported
    without this general authorization.</p>
    <p>All imports of Category 1 radioactive sources into Canada
    are subject to the CNSC's consent prior to import.</p>
    <p>All imports of Category 1 and 2 radioactive sources also
    require prior shipment notifications (to be issued by the
    exporting facility or the exporting state authority).</p>
    <h2 id="sec3">Instructions for completing an application for a
    licence to export risk-significant radioactive sources</h2>
    <p>The following instructions provide guidance on submitting
    appropriate information to accompany an application to export
    risk-significant radioactive sources:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="#secB-1">Important notes</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="#secB-2">Overview of the application form</a>
      </li>

      </li>

        <a href="#secB-4">Supplemental information</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="secB-1">Important notes</h3>
    <ol class="list-lower-alpha">
      <li>Complete, sign and print the application form. Email, fax
      or mail the document to the CNSC address listed at the bottom
      of the form.</li>
      <li>All mandatory information must be provided. Additional
      information may be submitted on a separate sheet. Incomplete
      applications cannot be processed and may result in delays.
      The CNSC may request additional information or
      documents.</li>
      <li>The period to review an application is typically 30
      business days upon receipt. For more details refer to
      “Processing time” below.</li>
      <li>Upon approval of the application, a licence to export
      risk-significant radioactive sources will be issued and sent
      by email to the applicant.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Processing time</h3>
    <p>A CNSC decision on an export licence application will
    generally depend, in part, on the scope of international
    communications and consultations required. The length of time
    for completing these will depend on a variety of factors, such
    as the state of the importing country’s regulatory
    import/export control program, the availability of information
    about the importer, and whether the export item is a Category 1
    or Category 2 source. In some cases, additional time may be
    required to process an export licence application. Applicants
    are encouraged to apply for an export licence at the earliest
    opportunity.</p>

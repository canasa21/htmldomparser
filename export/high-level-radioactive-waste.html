  <title>High-level radioactive waste</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>High-level radioactive waste (HLW) is used (irradiated)
  nuclear fuel whose owners have declared it as radioactive waste
  and/or which generates significant heat through radioactive
  decay. HLW typically has levels of activity concentration in the
  range of 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> TBq/m<sup>3</sup>. HLW
  is associated with penetrating radiation, which means that
  shielding is required. HLW also contains significant quantities
  of long-lived radionuclides, which necessitates long-term
  isolation.</p>

  <h2 id="used-fuel">Used nuclear fuel from nuclear power plants,
  prototype and research reactors</h2>
  <p>Canada's inventory of <a href=
  "/eng/acts-and-regulations/regulatory-documents/published/html/regdoc3-6/u.cfm/#used_nuclear_fuel">
  used nuclear fuel</a> comes mostly from the operation of nuclear
  power plants. The remainder of the used nuclear fuel – which
  accounts for approximately 2% of the total inventory – comes from
  prototype reactors (used to test full-power reactor designs) and
  research reactors.</p>
  <p>Since the 1960s, Canada's nuclear power reactors have used
  over 2.5 million fuel bundles. If these bundles were packed end
  to end, they would fit into a space the size of 7 hockey rinks,
  stacked to the top of the boards.</p>
  <p>Used nuclear fuel from the operation of nuclear power plants
  is kept in onsite interim storage facilities. The storage
  consists of 2 phases: wet storage and dry storage.</p>
  <h3 id="wet">Wet storage</h3>
  <p>After being removed from the reactors, used nuclear fuel
  bundles are stored for 6 to 10 years in storage bays (pools of
  water), which provide cooling and shielding against
  radiation.</p>
  <p>The pools for the used nuclear fuel are constructed in-ground
  and are seismically qualified (which means they are built to meet
  seismic standards for withstanding earthquakes). The pools are
  located in buildings that are separated from the reactor
  buildings.</p>
  <p>The walls and floors of the pools are about 2 metres thick and
  made of concrete reinforced with carbon steel.</p>
  <p>Robust, heat-resistant and water-tight liners are installed in
  the pools to prevent water from leaking through possible defects
  in the concrete.</p>
  <p>CNSC certified inspectors regularly inspect the pools.</p>
  <p>Since the March 2011 accident in Fukushima, Japan, all nuclear
  power plant operators in Canada have acquired additional
  transportable equipment (such as portable generators and pumps)
  to ensure pools can be filled with water regardless of an
  accident's severity.</p>
  <p><strong>Did you know?</strong></p>
  <p>Each year, 4,500 to 5,400 fuel bundles per power reactor are
  added to the pools (based on 80% to 95% of full-power reactor
  operation).</p>
  <h3 id="dry">Dry storage</h3>
  <p>After 7 to 10 years in wet storage, the used nuclear fuel can
  be safely transferred to dry storage.</p>
  <p>There are 3 main types of dry storage units used in
  Canada:&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>concrete canisters</li>
    <li>Modular Air-cooled STORage (MACSTOR) units</li>
    <li>dry storage containers</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Concrete canisters</strong>, or silos, were developed
  in the 1970s by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) at
  Whiteshell Laboratories in Manitoba, to demonstrate that dry
  storage for used reactor fuel was a feasible alternative to
  underwater storage.</p>
  <p>Silos are now used to store the used fuel from New Brunswick
  Power's Point Lepreau Generating Station, as well as prototype
  reactors that are operated or decommissioned by Canadian Nuclear
  Laboratories (including those at Chalk River Laboratories (CRL),
  Whiteshell Laboratories, Gentilly-1 and Douglas Point). Each silo
  can hold between 325 and 600 bundles, and is built on reinforced
  concrete foundations.</p>
  <p>The <strong>MACSTOR</strong> units, also developed by AECL,
  are similar to silos but much larger. Each MACSTOR unit can store
  12,000 bundles of used fuel.</p>
  <p>MACSTOR units are currently installed at the Gentilly-2
  Facilities. These facilities are currently in a safe shutdown
  state and have been granted a decommissioning licence.</p>
  <p><strong>Dry storage containers</strong> were developed by
  Ontario Power Generation (OPG) and are made of reinforced
  concrete encased in interior and exterior shells made of carbon
  steel.</p>
  <p>The containers are transportable and are filled with helium
  (an inert gas), which protects the fuel bundles from potential
  oxidation.</p>
  <p>Each dry storage container unit is designed to hold 384 fuel
  bundles and weighs approximately 60 tonnes when empty and 70
  tonnes when loaded.</p>
  <p>The dry storage containers are currently used to store the
  used nuclear fuel from the Pickering, Darlington and Bruce A and
  B nuclear power plants.</p>
  <p>Operating experience and rigorous inspections carried out over
  the last 35 years have demonstrated that different types of dry
  storage units used in Canada can all effectively contain
  radiation.</p>
  <p>All transfers of used nuclear fuel from wet storage to dry
  storage are conducted under surveillance of the <a href=
  "https://www.iaea.org/">International Atomic Energy
  Agency</a>.</p>
  <p>Used nuclear fuel from research reactors is either repatriated
  to the fuel’s country of origin, or safely managed through
  interim storage in Canada.</p>
  <h2 id="other">Other high-level radioactive waste</h2>
  <p>A small amount of non-nuclear-fuel high-level radioactive
  waste exists in Canada, and all of it is stored at Chalk River
  Laboratories. &nbsp;</p>
  <p>This waste comes from 2 main sources: the production of
  medical isotopes and waste generated from early reprocessing
  experiments conducted from the 1940s to the 1960s.</p>
  <h3>Early reprocessing experiments</h3>
  <p>CRL stores liquid from fuel reprocessing (done between 1949
  and 1956). The waste is stored in 3 tanks. The last transfer of
  radioactive liquid solutions to any of these storage tanks
  occurred in 1968, and no liquids have been added since then.</p>
  <p>Between 1958 and 1960, AECL conducted some experiments to
  convert high-level radioactive liquid solutions into a solid
  (glass). The program generated 50 glass blocks, each weighing
  about 2 kilograms, which are now safely stored onsite.</p>
  <h2 id="transportation">Transportation of high-level radioactive
  waste</h2>
  <p>The CNSC certifies the&nbsp;design of the packages required
  for&nbsp;the transport of used nuclear fuel and other high-level
  radioactive waste.</p>
  <p>The design of certified&nbsp;transport packages must
  demonstrate the ability of the packages to retain their contents
  under accident conditions.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Canadian regulatory requirements state that all certified
  transport packages shall undergo stringent testing, including the
  ability to withstand the cumulative effects of a 9-metre drop
  onto an unyielding surface, a 30-minute thermal test at
  800&nbsp;°C, and immersion in 15 metres of water for 1 hour
  without a breach of containment.</p>
  <p>High-level radioactive waste has been transported safely
  nationally and internationally for over 45 years by road, rail,
  water and air, without a single radiological incident.</p>
  <h2 id="long-term">Long-term management of used nuclear fuel</h2>
  <p>The <a href="http://www.nwmo.ca/">Nuclear Waste Management
  Organization</a> (NWMO) is responsible for the long-term
  management of Canada's used nuclear fuel.</p>
  <p>In May 2010, the NWMO launched its <a href=
  "http://www.nwmo.ca/sitingprocess">site selection process</a> for
  a willing and informed community to host a <a href=
  "/eng/waste/deep-geological-repositories.cfm">deep geological
  repository</a> for the long-term management of Canada's used
  nuclear fuel.</p>
  <p>As Canada's nuclear regulator, the CNSC is responsible for
  licensing geological repositories intended to provide long-term
  management of radioactive waste. At this time, the CNSC has not
  yet received any applications for site preparation and
  construction of a deep geological repository that will provide
  long-term management of radioactive waste.</p>

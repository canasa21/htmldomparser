<body>
  <p>To perform gamma radiography or operate an exposure device in
  Canada, the law requires you to be certified by the Canadian
  Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) as an exposure device operator
  (EDO) or be working under the direct supervision of a certified
  EDO.</p>
  <div class="col-md-12 alert alert-info">
    <p>As of January 1, 2017, the CNSC will consider a worker
    qualified to operate an exposure device <strong>only</strong>
    if they have a valid EDO certification card (that is, a card
    issued on or after February 1, 2013 that has not expired). As a
    result, any EDO whose certification card does not have an
    expiry date or whose certification card has expired will not be
    considered qualified to work as a certified EDO.</p>

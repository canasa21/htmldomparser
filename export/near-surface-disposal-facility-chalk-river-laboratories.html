        <p>The NSDF application to the CNSC</p>
        <p>We’re the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, Canada’s
        nuclear regulator.</p>
        <p>Our staff are reviewing the application from Canadian
        Nuclear Laboratories to build a Near Surface Disposal
        Facility (NSDF) in Chalk River, Ontario.</p>
        <p>What does “near surface disposal” mean?</p>
        <p>An NSDF is a type of waste facility where radioactive
        waste is stored at or below the ground’s surface.</p>
        <p>In order to prevent contaminants from getting into the
        surrounding environment, the waste is placed in vaults or
        cells, with a special bottom liner.</p>
        <p>This project would include 10 storage cells. When a cell
        is full, a cover will be placed on top to seal the waste
        and protect it from contact with people, animals and
        weather.</p>
        <p>Protecting our water</p>
        <p>We know there are concerns about the proposed Near
        Surface Disposal Facility affecting the Ottawa River.</p>
        <p>That’s why over 50 specialized scientific and technical
        experts, like geoscientists and structural engineers, at
        the CNSC and across government are carefully reviewing
        every detail of CNL’s application, taking into account
        international best practices.</p>
        <p>It’s their job to ensure the facility will meet Canada’s
        rigorous standards for protecting people and the
        environment:</p>
        <p>They’re assessing protective materials planned for the
        facility, to ensure that the liner and cover systems
        contain and isolate the waste.</p>
        <p>They’re studying water flows to ensure the impact on the
        Ottawa River would be negligible if small amounts of
        contaminants ever travelled to the river, both during
        operation and after the facility is shut down.</p>
        <p>They’re also assessing whether the structure could
        withstand very severe earthquakes.</p>
        <p>Like you, we want to protect the environment, so we all
        have clean water, air and soil — now and for future
        generations.</p>

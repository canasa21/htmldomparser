  <title>Radioisotope Safety – Monitoring for Radioactive
  Contamination</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>This appendix provides general guidance for monitoring and
  controlling radioactive contamination, and relating the
  monitoring results to the contamination limits specified in CNSC
  licences. The appendix also provides guidance on contamination
  monitoring instrument selection. Certain CNSC licences
  authorizing the use of unsealed nuclear substances contain a
  condition that states the regulatory criteria pertaining to
  radioactive contamination. The specified contamination criteria
  should be applied to all areas where unsealed nuclear substances
  are used/present, or have been used. Notwithstanding these
  limits, licensees should maintain levels of radioactive
  contamination as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA).</p>
  <h2>1.0 Elements of a contamination monitoring program</h2>
  <h3>1.1 Method of measurement</h3>
  <p>Radioactive contamination may be measured directly or
  indirectly. Direct measurement generally means the use of
  portable radiation detection instruments to detect both fixed and
  removable contamination. Direct measurement may be used when
  background radiation levels are negligible compared to licence
  criteria. Indirect measurement only detects removable
  contamination by means of a sampling program.</p>
  <h3>1.2 Instrument selection</h3>
  <p>The ability of various radiation detection instruments to
  detect radioisotopes will vary by instrument and manufacturer.
  Guidance on the selection of instruments can be found in the
  section “Selection of contamination monitoring instruments”. For
  specific information on a particular model, contact the
  manufacturer.</p>
  <h2>2.0 Contamination monitoring</h2>
  <h3>2.1 Purpose</h3>
  <p>The locations selected for contamination monitoring should be
  numbered on a plan of the work area. These locations should
  include working surfaces (such as benches, countertops or fume
  hoods), storage areas, and non-working surfaces (such as floors,
  instruments and equipment, door handles, light switches, sink
  taps and telephones). Several random locations should also be
  monitored. Too rigid a set of locations may overlook problem
  areas. The list of locations should be reviewed at a sufficient
  frequency to determine whether the list is current or new
  locations should be added.</p>
  <h3>2.2 Instrument checks</h3>
  <p>All instruments used for counting samples, such as liquid
  scintillation counters, well-type crystal gamma counters,
  gas-flow proportional counters, semiconductor gamma spectrometers
  and gamma cameras, should be routinely serviced according to the
  manufacturer’s instructions. Licensees must keep a record of the
  servicing with the date. Before monitoring for contamination, all
  instruments should be given operational checks as specified by
  the manufacturer; i.e., battery check, high-voltage check,
  response check and the background radiation level should be
  measured. Licensees must keep a record of the operational checks
  and background measurement. Similarly, the instruments should be
  used to measure the radiation from a standard such as a check
  source for every set of contamination monitoring measurements
  performed. The results of those measurements allow the
  determination of the instrument efficiency.</p>
  <p>Instruments that are not operating within the parameters of
  operational checks, or that show anomalous background, blank or
  standard measurements, should not be used until their proper
  operation can be verified. These instruments should be tagged
  indicating that they are out of service and should not be used
  until their proper operation can be verified.</p>
  <h3>2.3 Frequency of contamination monitoring</h3>
  <p>Contamination monitoring frequencies, which should be at least
  weekly during periods of regular use, should conform to the
  requirements indicated in the licensee’s radiation protection
  program. When radioactive substances are not used for a prolonged
  period of time, contamination monitoring is not required, but
  such a period should be identified in the records.</p>
  <h3>2.4 Direct measurement of contamination using a portable
  meter</h3>
  <p>Direct measurement instrument readings include both fixed and
  non-fixed contamination. Subsequently, a direct reading may be
  used to satisfy licence criteria for non-fixed contamination.</p>
  <h3>2.5 Indirect measurement of contamination with wipes</h3>
  <p>Perform the following steps for indirect measurements:<br></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Wipe each of the locations shown on the plan of the working
    area with a filter paper, wipe or cottonswab lightly moistened
    with alcohol or water. Use one numbered wipe per location. If
    contamination isfound, the contaminated area shall be
    identified and decontaminated.</li>
    <li>Wipe an area of 100 cm<sup>2</sup>. Using uniform and
    constant pressure, wipe the entire area. In situations
    wherewipes of 100 cm<sup>2</sup> areas are not feasible such as
    wipes of some equipment, light switches, etc., take noteof the
    area of the surface wiped and ensure the appropriate conversion
    factor is applied.</li>
    <li>If necessary, carefully dry the wipe to prevent loss of
    activity. Since the contamination may be absorbedinto the wipe
    material, the use of a wetting agent may lead to a significant
    underestimate of alpha andlow-energy beta contamination with
    some counting methods.</li>
    <li>Count the wipes in a low-background area and record all
    results.</li>
    <li>If the wipes are to be counted on a contamination meter,
    the wipe should be smaller than or equal to thesensitive area
    of the detector. Note that the geometry of the wipe material
    (flat like filter paper or roundlike a swab) may change
    results.</li>
    <li>Clean any contaminated areas and monitor again. Record
    results before and after decontamination.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2.6 Decontamination</h3>
  <p>Any area that is found to have non-fixed contamination
  exceeding the contamination criteria shall be cleaned and
  monitored again. If the area cannot be cleaned to meet those
  criteria, the contaminated area shall be sealed or shielded until
  the criteria are met. All non-fixed contamination should be
  removed if possible. Note: For short-lived radionuclides, the
  room or area may be posted and secured until the radioisotope
  decays.</p>
  <p>Note: For short-lived radionuclides, the room or area may be
  posted and secured until the radioisotope decays.</p>
  <h3>2.7 Monitoring records</h3>
  <p>Contamination monitoring records shall be available for
  inspection by CNSC staff. These records should include:<br></p>
  <ul>
    <li>date of measurement</li>
    <li>make and model of the instrument</li>
    <li>monitoring locations</li>
    <li>contamination monitoring results in Bq/cm<sup>2</sup>
    before and after decontamination, if applicable</li>
    <li>results of operational checks and background
    measurements</li>
    <li>standard measurement results</li>
    <li>measured or predicted efficiency</li>
    <li>instrument servicing records should be recorded and updated
    as necessary</li>
    <li>demonstration that the chosen instrument and counting
    methods yield a minimum detectable activitybelow the applicable
    criteria</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2.8 Regulatory criteria for radioactive contamination</h3>
  <p>The licensee shall ensure that for nuclear substances listed
  in Appendix A: Classes of Nuclear Substances:<br></p>
  <ul>
    <li>non-fixed contamination in all areas, rooms or enclosures
    where unsealed nuclear substances areused or stored does not
    exceed:
      <ul>
        <li>3 Bq/cm<sup>2</sup> for all Class A radionuclides</li>
        <li>30 Bq/cm<sup>2</sup> for all Class B radionuclides</li>
        <li>300 Bq/cm<sup>2</sup> for all Class C radionuclides,
        averaged over an area not exceeding 100 cm<sup>2</sup></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>non-fixed contamination in all other areas does not exceed:
      <ul>
        <li>0.3 Bq/cm<sup>2</sup> for all Class A
        radionuclides</li>
        <li>3 Bq/cm<sup>2</sup> for all Class B radionuclides</li>
        <li>30 Bq/cm<sup>2</sup> for all Class C radionuclides,
        averaged over an area not exceeding 100 cm<sup>2</sup></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>2.8.1 Relating measurement readings to regulatory
  criteria</h4>
  <p>The readings from contamination meters can be related to
  regulatory criteria if the efficiency of the instrument for a
  specific nuclear substance is known. Instrument efficiencies for
  specific nuclear substances can be obtained from the manufacturer
  or determined using an appropriate standard of known activity.
  For mixtures of nuclear substances, identify the isotope for
  which the detector has the lowest response at the applicable
  contamination limit. Using the following equation, calculate the
  measurement results in Bq/cm<sup>2</sup></p><math display=

  N = the total count rate in counts per minute (cpm) measured
  directly or on the wipe.<br>
  NB = the normal background count rate (in cpm) from the portable
  survey instrument or the count rate (in cpm) from a blank sample
  using a benchtop instrument<br>

  i.e. for 5 percent efficiency, E=0.05) for the radioisotope being

  <h3>2.9 Minimum detectable activity</h3>
  <p>The minimum detectable activity (MDA) is defined as the
  minimum amount of activity in a sample that can be detected with
  a 5-percent probability of erroneously detecting radioactivity
  when none is present, and a 5-percent probability of not
  detecting radioactivity when it is present. For any given system
  designed to count and quantify radioactivity, the MDA should be
  calculated for the most restrictive scenario (i.e., for the
  nuclide with the lowest detection efficiency and the most
  restrictive regulatory criterion). The units of the MDA (Bq,
  Bq/gr, Bq/cm<sup>2</sup>) should be the same as those expressed
  in the licence or regulatory criterion, as applicable. The MDA in
  Bq/cm<sup>2</sup>, can be calculated as

  <p>Where the terms NB, E, A and F have the same meanings as the
  section above and</p>
  <p>T = the counting time, in seconds, for indirect wipe
  monitoring, and is the instrument response time for direct
  measurements (or the actual time if performing scalar counting).
  The instrument response time will vary between instruments and is
  a parameter which can be selected by the user on some devices;
  e.g., via either software selection of the actual time or
  “fast/slow” switch set to predefined timesspecified in the user
  manual. Other instruments may auto-select the response time based
  on the countrate. Longer response times will improve the MDA, but
  the instrument shall stay stationary over eacharea for a period
  that is at least as long as the response time.</p>
  <p>Note: the efficiency, and hence the MDA of the instrument is
  highly dependent on the distance between the source and the
  detector. The MDA should be calculated for the distance at which
  the detector will be when monitoring.</p>
  <h3>2.10 Selection of contamination monitoring instruments</h3>
  <p>The MDA for a nuclear substance will depend on both the types
  and energies of radiation emitted by that nuclear substance and
  on the type of detector used. In general, there are three basic
  detector design considerations that will impact instrument
  sensitivity, and each of these parameters will have a different
  impact, depending upon the type and energy of radiation being
  detected:</p>
  <h4>2.10.1 Window thickness and composition</h4>
  <p>Consideration should be given to whether the window density is
  small enough to allow the radiation emitted by source to enter
  the detector. This is critical for low-energy beta radiation and
  alpha radiation, which can be completely absorbed even by
  materials as thin as a sheet of paper. Note that some isotopes,
  such as H-3 or Ni-63, cannot be detected by most instruments,
  because the beta radiation they emit gets completely absorbed
  within the window. For such isotopes, indirect monitoring using
  liquid scintillation is generally the best choice.</p>
  <h4>2.10.2 Detector density</h4>
  <p>Every radiation detector functions by detecting interactions
  between the radiation and a material within the detector. There
  are two broad classes of detectors: gas-filled detectors, and
  solid or liquid scintillators. Gas-filled detectors, such as
  Geiger detectors and proportional counters, will generally work
  well for detecting alpha or beta radiation, since these types of
  radiation will cause interactions even in low-density materials.
  Conversely, gamma rays may readily pass through a low-density gas
  without interaction, especially at high energies. Solid
  scintillators, such as NaI detectors, are generally much better
  suited to detecting gamma radiation. Thin crystal detectors are
  suitable for low-energy gamma emitters such as Tc-99m, while
  thicker detectors will enhance sensitivity for high-energy gammas
  such as those from Cs-137 or Co-60.</p>
  <h4>2.10.3 Detector output</h4>
  <p>Every time radiation interacts with a detector, a tiny amount
  of energy is released within the detector. This energy is then
  converted into an electronic signal that can be measured. Some
  detectors, such as Geiger counters, produce uniform pulses which
  can be counted. Other systems, such as scintillators or
  proportional counters, may produce a signal that is proportional
  to the amount of energy released in the initial radiation
  interaction. This can be used to distinguish between different
  types of radiation or different energies of radiation of the same
  type. Such detectors are useful in applications where
  distinguishing between multiple different isotopes may be
  necessary.</p>

  <p>Ion chambers are another major type of portable detector.
  These devices are intended for measurement of radiation dose
  rates rather than contamination. In general, they are poorly
  suited to contamination monitoring and should not be used for
  this purpose.</p>
  <p>** Nuclear substances that decay via emission of alpha or beta
  particles often also emit gamma rays. Many isotopes, especially
  high atomic number materials such as uranium and radium, may
  exist in equilibrium with the other isotopes in their “decay
  chain”, which in turn emit many different types and energies
  of<br>
  radiation. When choosing a contamination monitor, it is important
  to consider exactly what types of radiation will be present. For
  example, positron emission tomography (PET) isotopes decay by
  the<br>
  emission of a positron (beta+) which in turn produces two
  high-energy (511 keV) gamma rays. It is the gamma rays that are
  of primary importance in the use of these isotopes, and a thick
  crystal NaI scintillator will detect these gammas very
  efficiently. However, a thin window Geiger detector will detect
  the beta+ emissions even more efficiently, and will generally
  have a much lower background (NB) count-rate.</p>

  <h2>Appendix A: Classes of Nuclear Substances</h2>
  <p>The following table organizes a number of common nuclear
  substances, including those for which surface contamination and
  waste disposal limits are typically incorporated into CNSC
  licences, into three classes -Class A, Class B, or Class C- on
  the basis of common radiological characteristics.</p>
  <p>To find out the classification, for regulatory purposes, of
  any nuclear substance that is not listed below, contact a CNSC
  Licensing Specialist at 1-888-229-2672.<br></p>

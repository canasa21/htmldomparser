<body>
  <p>Uranium is a naturally occurring radioactive element used for
  fuel in nuclear power reactors. Canada is one of the world's
  largest uranium producers. The majority of Canada's production is
  exported.</p>
  <p>Uranium is mined to provide uranium ore which is processed at
  a milling facility to produce uranium concentrate. The uranium
  concentrate is then <a href=
  "/eng/uranium/processing/index.cfm">processed further to create
  fuel</a> for <a href=
  "/eng/reactors/power-plants/index.cfm">nuclear reactors</a>.</p>

  <p>The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) is responsible
  for regulating and licensing all existing and future uranium
  mining and milling operations in Canada.</p>
  <p>The CNSC's work is undertaken in accordance with the
  comprehensive requirements of the <em><a href=
  "http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-28.3/">Nuclear Safety
  and Control Act</a></em> (NSCA) and its related regulations,
  which reflect Canadian and international safety standards.</p>
  <p>The CNSC and its staff focus on health, safety, security and
  the environment, and ensure Canada implements its <a href=
  "/eng/resources/international-cooperation/international-agreements.cfm">
  international obligations on the safe use of nuclear
  materials.</a></p>

  <h3 id="LicensingProcess">Licensing process</h3>
  <p>The <a href=
  "/eng/acts-and-regulations/regulatory-documents/history/REGDOC3-5-1.cfm">
  CNSC's licensing process for uranium mines and mills</a> follows
  the stages laid out in the <a href=
  "http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2000-206/page-1.html">
  <em>Uranium Mines and Mills Regulations</em></a>, proceeding
  progressively through site preparation and construction,
  operating, decommissioning, and abandonment (or release from
  licensing) phases.</p>
  <p>Using this lifecycle approach to licensing, the CNSC issues
  licences for all phases in the lifecycle of a uranium mine and
  mill.</p>
  <p>The CNSC exercises rigorous regulatory oversight and ensures
  that each licensee has a financial guarantee in place for each
  facility - at all phases - to cover its eventual decommissioning
  costs. In addition, under the <a href=
  "http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2003-212/FullText.html">
  <em>CNSC Cost Recovery Fees Regulations</em></a>, the CNSC
  charges back to the licensee all costs associated with the
  regulatory activities.</p>
  <p>At each licensing stage, the CNSC determines whether the
  licence applicant is qualified and has made adequate provisions
  for the protection of health and safety of person and
  environment.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Applicants must also demonstrate the required measures to
  maintain national security and implement Canada's international
  obligations for the peaceful use of nuclear energy. In addition,
  uranium mines and mills are also subject to applicable
  environmental review requirements. For further information,
  please visit the CNSCâ€™s Environmental reviews page.</p>
  <h3 id="CNSCComplianceActivities">CNSC compliance activities</h3>
  <p>CNSC staff perform compliance activities for operating and
  decommissioned mines and mills. Compliance activities include
  facility inspections, application requests, review of licensee
  reports, and environmental, radiation and conventional health and
  safety data analysis.</p>
  <p>CNSC certified inspectors conduct regular inspections at
  operating and decommissioned facilities. These inspections are
  shared with employees at the facility, the <a href=
  "http://www.saskatchewan.ca/residents/first-nations-citizens/saskatchewan-first-nations-metis-and-northern-initiatives/northern-saskatchewan-environmental-quality-committee">
  Northern Saskatchewan Environmental Quality Committee</a> and
  other regulators. Inspections are conducted with other regulatory
  agencies, such as the provincial or territorial departments of
  Environment and Labour, and representatives from other federal
  government departments (for example, Environment Canada and
  Fisheries and Oceans).</p>
  <p>An example of an area the CNSC regulates is <a href=
  "/eng/resources/fact-sheets/radon.cfm">radon</a> exposure in
  uranium mines and mills. The CNSC requires licensees have
  engineering design and control processes to remove radon to limit
  exposure to workers. Radon is naturally produced by the decay of
  uranium and is released into the air when uranium ore is mined
  and milled. Radon gas produced during mining and milling is
  continuously monitored, controlled, and safely ventilated away
  from the workers. Presently, worker exposures to radon in the
  uranium mining and processing industry are as low as, or only
  slightly greater than, public exposure from natural radon.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Licensees are required to notify the CNSC of significant
  events or situations outside the normal operations described in
  their licensing documents or due to public interest. Such events
  rarely, if ever, result in significant effects on the health and
  safety of people or the environment. Significant events are
  reported to the Commission via event initial reports which,
  depending on the nature and severity of the event, may be
  followed up with detailed compliance activities, corrective
  actions and/or <a href=
  "/eng/acts-and-regulations/regulatory-action/index.cfm">regulatory
  action taken by the CNSC</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="OperatingUraniumMinesandMills">Operating uranium mines

  <p>At this time, all operating uranium mines and mills in Canada
  are located in northern Saskatchewan. <a href=

  <p>Surface exploration for uranium is exempt from NSCA
  requirements because it poses low risks. Each province or
  territory is responsible for regulating and monitoring
  exploration activities within its jurisdiction and informing the
  public about those activities. Advanced exploration activities,
  such as exploration ramps through mineralized zones fall within
  the regulatory framework of the CNSC, and a licence is required
  before these activities can proceed.</p>

  <p>As with other major facilities, operating licences for uranium
  mines and mills are issued for specific time periods, usually
  from five to ten years. Renewals of existing licences and all
  proposals for new mining and milling activities require <a href=
  "/eng/the-commission/index.cfm">Commission</a> approval.</p>
  <h3 id="ProposedUraniumMinesandMills">Proposed uranium mines and
  mills</h3>
  <p>New uranium mine and mill projects are currently being
  proposed in Saskatchewan, Quebec and Nunavut.</p>
  <p>Proposed uranium mines and mills are subject to applicable
  environmental review requirements. For further information,
  please visit the <a href=
  "/eng/resources/environmental-assessments/index.cfm">CNSCâ€™s
  Environmental reviews page</a>.</p>
  <p>The CNSC's licensing process for new uranium mines and mills
  follows the stages outlined in the <a href=

  <em>Uranium Mines and Mills Regulations</em></a>, proceeding
  progressively through site preparation and construction,
  operating, decommissioning, and abandonment (or release from
  licensing) phases. EAs can also be completed for new projects at
  existing nuclear facilities.</p>

    <h2 id="R2">Comment on discussion papers</h2>
    <p>Discussion papers play an important role in the selection
    and development of the CNSC's requirements or guidance. They
    are used to solicit early public feedback on CNSC policies or
    approaches. The use of discussion papers early in the
    regulatory process underlines the CNSC's commitment to a
    transparent consultation process. The CNSC analyzes and
    considers this early feedback when determining the type and
    nature of requirements and guidance to issue. This process is
    intended to streamline document development and publishing.</p>

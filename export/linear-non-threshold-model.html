  Fact Sheet: Linear-Non-Threshold Model</a> (<abbr title=
  "Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr>)</p>
  <p>The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) regulates the
  use of nuclear energy and materials to protect the health, safety
  and security of Canadians and the environment. One of the ways
  the CNSC ensures health and safety is through setting
  regulations, including dose limits for workers and members of the
  public. To help set these limits, the CNSC joins the
  international community in relying on a radiation protection risk
  model known as the Linear-Non-Threshold (LNT) model.</p>
  <p>The LNT model assumes a direct and proportional relationship
  between radiation exposure and cancer risk with all radiation
  doses. It provides an understanding of radiation health risks
  that informs the setting of dose limits and regulations that
  limit exposure to an acceptable level. Radiation doses at or
  below these limits are considered safe in that there is no direct
  medical or scientific evidence to show that they cause harm.</p>
  <p>The risks from radiation have been largely derived from atomic
  bomb survivor studies, where the incidence of disease
  (principally cancer) was plotted against radiation dose. Where
  there was data, the dose response was linear, meaning that as
  dose increased so did cancer risk. However, below the lowest data
  point, the natural incidence of the disease masked any effects
  that may have been caused by radiation. Because of this, the LNT
  model assumes that cancer incidence as it relates to radiation
  dose behaves in the same way as at higher doses; that is, in a
  linear manner.</p>
  <p>Reports by the International Commission on Radiological
  Protection (<a href=
  "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01466453/35/4">ICRP
  99</a>, 2006) and the U.S. National Research Council of the
  National Academies (<a href=
  "http://www.nap.edu/catalog/5499/health-effects-of-exposure-to-radon-beir-vi">BEIR
  VII</a>, 2006) state that while evidence supports other models,
  the LNT model provides the best overall fit for radiation
  protection purposes.</p>

    <h3>Quick facts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The LNT is a risk model used internationally by most
      health agencies and nuclear regulators, including the CNSC,
      to set dose limits for workers and members of the
      public.</li>
      <li>The LNT model conservatively assumes there is a direct
      relationship between radiation exposure and cancer
      rates.</li>
      <li>There is little scientific evidence of any measurable
      adverse health effects at radiation doses below about 100
      millisieverts (mSv).</li>
      <li>The CNSC's approach to radiation protection is prudent
      and ensures the health and safety of Canadians and the
      protection of their environment</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h3>Radiation risk models</h3>
  <div class=
  "alert alert-warning module-simplify span-3 pull-right">
    <p>"Baseline cancer rates" refer to the number of naturally
    occurring cancers expected in a given population. "Excess
    cancers" refers to any increase in cancer rates.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Despite widespread acceptance of the LNT model for radiation
  protection purposes, several alternate theories have been
  proposed to explain the relationship between radiation exposure
  and cancer risk. Scientists have proposed these alternate
  theories based on models of cellular and sub-cellular responses
  to radiation at very low doses to address findings of studies
  that do not follow the LNT model. Figure 1 illustrates different
  radiation risk models that estimate the risk of cancer below the
  lowest dose where excess cancers have been observed (~
  100&nbsp;mSv). The black data points at 100 mSv and above are
  taken from epidemiological studies (including studies on radon in
  homes, nuclear energy workers, medical exposures and the atomic
  bomb survivors).</p>

  "Radiation Risk Models">
  <ul>
    <li>The hypersensitivity model suggests a greater risk at lower
    doses.</li>
    <li>The LNT model is the straight line that is extrapolated to
    zero, meaning that cancer risk will rise with increasing
    dose.</li>
    <li>The threshold model implies that below a certain dose,
    there is no risk.</li>
    <li>The hormesis model suggests that low radiation doses may
    even be protective and beneficial.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Radiation protection in Canada</h3>
  <div class=
  "alert alert-warning module-simplify span-3 pull-right">
    <p>The adoption of the LNT model led to the development of the
    ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) principle, which is a
    fundamental aspect of the CNSC's approach to radiation
    protection.</p>
  </div>
  <p>The CNSC applies the LNT model in its approach to radiation
  protection, as a prudent way to protect Canadians from radiation,
  keeping pace with its international peers.</p>
  <p>Regulatory radiation dose limits for workers at nuclear
  facilities and members of the general public are set to restrict
  exposures to acceptable levels. The CNSC also requires all
  licensees to keep radiation levels as low as reasonably
  achievable (ALARA), economic and social factors being taken into
  account.</p>
  <p>The regulatory dose limit for a member of the public in Canada
  is 1 millisievert (mSv) per year, while the dose limit for a
  nuclear energy worker is 50 mSv per year and
  100&nbsp;mSv&nbsp;over a five-year period. These limits are based
  on international standards that have been derived from the best
  scientific knowledge available.</p>
  <p>Canada's nuclear facilities have a strong track record of
  keeping radiation doses far below the limits set by the
  regulations. Figure 2 shows that maximum annual radiation doses
  to members of the public living near nuclear power plants were
  under one percent of the 1 mSv limit.</p>

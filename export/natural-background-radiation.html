  <h2>Quick facts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Radiation has always been present and is all around us in
    many natural forms. Life has evolved in a world with
    significant levels of ionizing radiation.</li>
    <li>Many radioisotopes are naturally occurring, and originated
    during the formation of the solar system and through the
    interaction of cosmic rays with molecules in the atmosphere.
    Tritium is an example of a radioisotope formed by this
    interaction.</li>
    <li>Radioisotopes such as polonium-210, carbon-14 and
    potassium-40 naturally occur within the human body.</li>
    <li>Potassium-40 is present in many common foods including red
    meats, white potatoes, carrots, bananas, lima beans and Brazil
    nuts.</li>
    <li>The annual average effective dose from natural background
    radiation is approximately 1.8 millisieverts (mSv) in Canada
    and 2.4 mSv worldwide.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Radiation is energy in motion, in the form of waves or streams
  of particles. Radiation has always been present and is all around
  us in many forms.</p>
  <p>When people hear the word radiation, they often think of
  atomic energy, nuclear power and radioactivity, but radiation has
  many different forms and comes from many other sources. Sound and
  visible light are familiar forms of radiation; other types
  include ultraviolet radiation (that produces a suntan), infrared
  radiation (a form of heat energy), and radio and television
  signals. These are examples of non-ionizing radiation.</p>
  <p>Ionizing radiation has the ability to knock electrons out of
  orbit around atoms, upsetting the electron/proton balance and
  potentially damaging cells. Examples include alpha, beta, gamma
  and neutron radiation and x-rays.</p>
  <p>Life has evolved in a world with significant levels of
  ionizing radiation and our bodies have adapted to it.</p>
  <h2>The electromagnetic spectrum</h2>
  <p><img src="./images/spectrum-waves-eng.jpg" alt=
  "The electromagnetic spectrum. The electromagnetic spectrum is the range of frequencies of electromagnetic radiation. It is divided into two main types of radiation: ionizing and non-ionizing. Ionizing radiation has a higher frequency with shorter wavelengths. Examples of ionizing radiation include cosmic rays, gamma rays and x-rays. Non-ionizing radiation has a lower frequency and longer wavelengths. Examples of non-ionizing radiation include ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, microwaves and radio waves."></p>
  <h2>Natural radiation sources</h2><img src=
  "./images/natural-radiation-sources-eng.jpg" alt=
  "Natural forms of radiation are found in cosmic rays, radioactive soil and rocks, radon, the human body and common foods.">
  <p>Background radiation is a constant source of ionizing
  radiation present in the environment and emitted from a variety
  of sources. According to the United Nations Scientific Committee
  on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), there are four
  major sources of natural radiation: cosmic radiation, terrestrial
  radiation and intakes of naturally occurring radionuclides
  through inhalation and ingestion.</p>
  <h3>Cosmic radiation</h3>
  <p>The earth’s outer atmosphere is continually bombarded by
  cosmic radiation. Usually it originates from a variety of
  sources, including the sun and other celestial events in the
  universe. Some ionizing radiation will penetrate the earth’s
  atmosphere and become absorbed by humans which results in natural
  radiation exposure.</p>
  <h3>Terrestrial radiation</h3>
  <p>The composition of the earth’s crust is a major source of
  natural radiation. The main contributors are natural deposits of
  uranium, potassium and thorium which, in the process of natural
  decay, will release small amounts of ionizing radiation. Uranium
  and thorium are found essentially everywhere. Traces of these
  minerals are also found in building materials so exposure to
  natural radiation can occur from indoors as well as outdoors.</p>
  <h3>Inhalation</h3>
  <p>Most of the variation in exposure to natural radiation results
  from inhalation of radioactive gases that are produced by
  radioactive minerals found in soil and bedrock. Radon is an
  odourless and colourless radioactive gas that is produced by the
  decay of uranium. Thoron is a radioactive gas produced by the
  decay of thorium. Radon and thoron levels vary considerably by
  location depending on the composition of soil and bedrock.</p>
  <p>Once released into the air, these gases will normally dilute
  to harmless levels in the atmosphere but sometimes they become
  trapped and accumulate inside buildings and are inhaled by
  occupants. Radon gas poses a health risk not only to uranium
  miners, but also to homeowners if it is left to collect in the
  home. On average, it is the largest source of natural radiation
  exposure.</p>
  <h3>Ingestion</h3>
  <p>Trace amounts of radioactive minerals are naturally found in
  the contents of food and drinking water. For instance, vegetables
  are typically cultivated in soil and ground water which contains
  radioactive minerals. Once ingested, these minerals result in
  internal exposure to natural radiation. Some of the essential
  elements that make up the human body, mainly potassium and
  carbon, have radioactive isotopes that add significantly to our
  background radiation dose.</p>
  <h3>Natural radiation doses</h3>
  <p>Effective dose is a general term that refers to the amount of
  energy absorbed by tissue from ionizing radiation. The effective
  dose is measured in sieverts (Sv) and is more commonly expressed
  in units of either millisieverts (mSv) – which represents a
  thousandth of a sievert – or microsieverts (μSv) – one millionth
  of a sievert. The total worldwide average effective dose from
  natural radiation is approximately 2.4 mSv per year; in Canada,
  it is 1.8 mSv. In some parts of the world, it is naturally much
  higher – for instance on the Kerala Coast in India, the annual
  effective dose is 12.5 mSv. The dose varies with the source of
  the radiation. For example, in northern Iran, geological
  characteristics result in a dose that can reach 260 mSv a
  year.</p>
  <h2>Doses from natural background radiation</h2>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Cosmic radiation</h3>
  <div class="col-md-2"><img src="./images/cosmic-radiation.png"
  alt="An aerial view of the sun rising over the earth."></div>
  <p>Regions at higher altitudes receive more cosmic radiation.
  According to a study by Health Canada, the annual effective dose
  of radiation from cosmic rays in Vancouver, British Columbia,
  which is at sea level, is about 0.30 mSv. This compares to the
  top of Mount Lorne, Yukon, where at 2,000 m, a person would
  receive a dose of about 0.84 mSv annually. Flying in an airplane
  increases exposure to cosmic radiation, resulting in a further
  average dose of 0.01 mSv per Canadian per year.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Terrestrial radiation</h3>
  <div class="col-md-2"><img src=
  "./images/terrestrial-radiation.png" alt=
  "An expansive mountain range. "></div>
  <p>There are also natural sources of radiation in the ground, and
  some regions receive more terrestrial radiation from soils that
  contain greater quantities of uranium. The average effective dose
  from the radiation emitted from the soil (and the construction
  materials that come from the ground) is approximately 0.5 mSv per
  year. However, this dose varies depending on location and
  geology, with doses reaching as high as 260 mSv in Northern Iran
  and 90 mSv in Nigeria. In Canada, the estimated highest annual
  dose for terrestrial radiation is approximately 1.4 mSv, as
  measured in the Northwest Territories.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Inhalation</h3>
  <div class="col-md-2"><img src=
  "./images/inhalation-radiation.png" alt=
  "The concrete foundation of a basement."></div>
  <p>The earth’s crust produces radon gas, which is present in the
  air we breathe. Radon gas naturally disperses as it enters the
  atmosphere from the ground. However, when radon gas enters a
  building (through the floor from the ground), a concentration of
  it tends to build up. Long-term exposure to elevated levels of
  radon increases the risk of developing lung cancer. The worldwide
  average annual effective dose of radon radiation is approximately
  1.2 mSv.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Ingestion</h3>
  <p>A number of sources of natural radiation penetrate our bodies
  through the food we eat, the air we breathe and the water we
  drink. Potassium-40 is the main source of internal irradiation
  (aside from radon decay) found in a variety of everyday foods.
  The average effective dose from these sources is approximately
  0.3 mSv a year.</p>
  <h2>Worldwide dose levels from natural background radiation</h2>
  <p>The total worldwide average effective dose from natural
  radiation is approximately 2.4 mSv a year. However, doses can
  vary greatly. The following figure shows how Canadian cities and
  the Canadian average dose compare to other parts of the
  world.</p>

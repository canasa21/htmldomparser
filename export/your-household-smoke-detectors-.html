  <title>Your household smoke detectors</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Smoke detectors are the most common consumer products that use
  nuclear technology to function. They are critical components of
  every household and workplace because of their ability to detect
  smoke in the air and identify potential fire hazards.</p>
  <h2>How do they work?</h2>
  <p>There are two primary technologies used in smoke detectors.
  One type uses a photoelectric sensor to detect the change in
  light level caused by smoke. The other uses the radiation from a
  small amount of radioactive material to sense smoke. These types
  of detectors, also referred to as ionization chamber smoke
  detectors, are the most commonly used because of their
  sensitivity and ability to identify a wider range of fire
  conditions.</p>
  <p>The americium-241 in ionization chamber smoke detectors makes
  the air in the detector’s sensing chamber conduct electricity.
  When smoke enters the sensing chamber, it interrupts the
  electrical current, triggering the smoke detector’s alarm.</p>
  <p>Ionizing smoke detectors are used in Canada because they are
  best at detecting quick burning fires, such as many of the fires
  which occur in North American buildings, which contain
  significant amounts of wood.</p>

  <h2>Radioactive properties</h2>
  <p>Most household detectors contain a very small amount of
  americium-241, a radioactive isotope. The slight amount of
  radiation that can be measured outside the unit does not pose any
  health risk. In fact, the average annual radiation dose from
  these devices per person represents 0.01&nbsp;percent of the dose
  they receive from natural background radiation. The safe
  encapsulation and low amount of radioactive material make these
  devices completely safe under all conditions, even during or
  after a fire.</p>

  <h2>Secure disposal</h2>
  <p>Consumers have three options when their ionizing smoke
  detector reaches its end of useful life:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>participating in municipal recycling programs for these
    devices</li>
    <li>contacting and returning their smoke detector to its
    manufacturer for disposal</li>
    <li>disposing household smoke detectors in regular municipal
    household garbage but not in recycling or composting waste,
    after the removal of its internal battery for proper
    disposal</li>
  </ol>
  <p>There is no limit as to how many residential smoke detectors
  you may dispose of at one time. Most households do not have more
  than one or two at their disposal anyway. However, hiring a
  consultant is recommended for the disposal of large institutional
  quantities or industrial smoke detectors.</p>
  <h2>Quick safety tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Batteries are used as either the sole or backup power
    source of the device, depending on the brand of smoke detector.
    Regardless of which kind of smoke detectors you have, it is a
    good idea to have batteries in them.</li>
    <li>If you hear a chirping or beeping sound, it is usually an
    indication that you should replace them. To be safe, routinely
    test your household devices by pressing the “test” btn to
    ensure their functionality.</li>
    <li>When it comes to the lifespan of the smoke detectors,
    different manufacturers may have varying replacement
    recommendations.&nbsp;</li>

  <h2>The CNSC’s role</h2>
  <p>Each smoke detector made in Canada must comply with strict
  radiation safety standards before their distribution. The CNSC is
  responsible for licensing the manufacturing and initial
  distribution of all smoke detectors containing a radioactive
  source in Canada. Check out our <a href=

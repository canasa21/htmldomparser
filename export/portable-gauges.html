  <!--div class="alert alert-info"> <h3>Notice of a potential defect in InstroTek 3500 Xplorer portable gauges</h3> <p>Some licensees have reported to the CNSC that InstroTek 3500 Xplorer portable gauges may be subject to a manufacturing defect. When retracted, the source rod may come out of the device if someone simply pulls on the rod. This defect affects only the portable gauges with serial numbers ranging from 3200 to 3289. If you have an InstroTek 3500 Xplorer portable gauge with a serial number in this range, the CNSC advises you to contact the Canadian distributor, Stuart Hunt &amp; Associates Ltd., by email at <a href="mailto:sales@stuarthunt.com">sales@stuarthunt.com</a> or by telephone at 1-800-661-4599. The CNSC also recommends that you stop using the gauge until it has been inspected and/or repaired.</p> </div-->
  <p>Gauges are used in industries such as agriculture,
  construction and civil engineering to measure moisture and
  compaction levels in soil and asphalt density in paving
  mixes.</p>
  <p>To do these measurements, two types of radiation are used in
  gauges: gamma (such as cesium-137) and neutron (such as
  americium-241/beryllium).</p>
  <p>Portable gauge licensees must ensure that doses are kept as
  low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). The CNSC facilitates this
  by regulating the use of radiation devices, by assessing
  radiation protection programs, and by regularly inspecting
  licensees to ensure compliance with the regulations and licence
  conditions.</p>
  <p>Portable gauge users must ensure that they safely conduct
  their work and comply with all applicable regulatory
  requirements. Their safety – as well as the safety of the public
  and the environment – depends at all times on a high level of
  radiation safety.</p>
  <p>Gauge users must comply with the radiation protection program
  established by their employer, in accordance with regulatory
  requirements. Risks that may jeopardize the integrity, safety or
  security of gauges, safe operations or radiation detection
  instruments have to be duly considered and mitigated.</p>
  <p>Each portable gauge must be either under the constant
  surveillance of a worker, or secured in a transport vehicle or at
  the storage location.</p>

  Safety and Control Act</em></a> (NSCA)<br>
  The NSCA came into force on May 31, 2000 when it replaced the
  <em>Atomic Energy Control Act</em>. It established the Canadian
  Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) and set out the CNSC's mandate,
  responsibilities and powers. This Act provided the CNSC with the
  authority to regulate the development, production and use of
  nuclear energy and the production, possession and use of nuclear
  substances, prescribed equipment and prescribed information in
  Canada.</p>
  <p>The CNSC also:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>conducts <a href=
    "/eng/resources/environmental-assessments/index.cfm">environmental
    assessments</a> under the <a href=
    "http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-15.21/index.html"><em>
      Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012</em></a>
    </li>
    <li>implements Canada's bilateral agreement with the
    International Atomic Energy Agency on <a href=
    "/eng/resources/international-cooperation/index.cfm#verification">
      nuclear safeguards verification</a>
    </li>
    <li>strengthens the compensation and civil liability regime for
    damages that result from a nuclear accident under the
      <a href="http://www.laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-28.1/FullText.html">
      <em>Nuclear Liability and Compensation Act</em></a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition to the NSCA, other federal acts may apply to the
  nuclear facilities and activities in Canada. Some of the more
  important pieces of legislation include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="#sec1">Nuclear security</a>
    </li>
    <li>

  <em>Nuclear Terrorism Act</em></a><br>
  Administered by <a href=
  "http://www.canada.justice.gc.ca/eng/index.html">Department of
  Justice</a><br>
  Scope: The <em>Nuclear Terrorism Act</em> will help combat
  nuclear terrorism by enhancing the domestic legal framework
  available to respond to the threat posed by acts of nuclear
  terrorism and by fulfilling key international commitments Canada
  has made in the area of nuclear security.</p>
  <p>The CNSC has been on the leading edge of implementing safety
  and security of our nuclear material inventory here in Canada.
  Its work is meant to be preventive so that nuclear terrorism
  efforts will be detected and thwarted as early as possible.</p>

  <p>The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) wishes to
  reassure members of the public that tritium levels in drinking
  water do not pose a risk to their health.</p>
  <p>August 20, 2009</p>
  <div class="alert alert-info">
    <h2>Quick facts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tritium levels measured in the drinking water of
      communities near nuclear facilities do not pose a health
      risk.</li>
      <li>Tritium levels found in the municipal drinking water of
      these communities are well below national and international
      standards, and below the 20 Bq/L limit proposed by the
      Ontario Drinking Water Advisory Council (ODWAC).</li>
      <li>Tritium releases from nuclear facilities only contribute
      a small amount to the overall exposure of Canadians to
      radiation. Background radiation and radiation from medical
      procedures represent the most significant sources of
      radioactive exposure for the public.</li>
      <li>Tritium levels are monitored continuously by provincial
      authorities, municipalities, nuclear power plant and tritium
      processing facility operators and AECL's Chalk River facility
      to ensure the protection of the public and the
      environment.</li>
      <li>The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) sets limits
      on releases from nuclear facilities into the environment and
      tracks these releases to ensure the protection of the public
      and the environment.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p>Media reports have recently highlighted the concerns of
  several citizens and groups about tritium levels in drinking
  water. The CNSC wants to reassure the public that the levels of
  tritium contained in the drinking water of communities near
  nuclear facilities do not pose a risk to their health.</p>

  <p>On June 9, 2009, the ODWAC released its <a href=
  "http://www.odwac.gov.on.ca/reports/minister%20reports/052109_ODWAC_Tritium_Report.pdf">
  Report and Advice on the Ontario Drinking Water Quality Standard
  for Tritium</a>. ODWAC recommends that the Ontario Ministry of
  Environment lowers its limits from 7,000 Bq/L to 20 Bq/L.</p>
  <p>Currently, the measured tritium levels in the municipal
  drinking water of the communities near nuclear facilities are
  well below all enforceable national and international standards,
  and below the ODWAC's proposed limits.</p>
  <h2>What is tritium?</h2>
  <p>Tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen. It emits very
  low-energy beta radiation, which is blocked by common materials
  such as sheets of plastic, glass or metal, and cannot penetrate
  the top layer of human skin. Tritium may be absorbed into the
  body through the skin or when ingested through water or food, or
  when inhaled.</p>
  <p>Tritium is a naturally occurring radioactive substance, which
  is formed in the upper atmosphere due to the continuous
  bombardment of atmospheric gases by high energy cosmic rays. In
  Canada, natural tritium levels vary between 0.2 and 1.4 Bq/L,
  depending on geographical location and other factors.</p>
  <p>Tritium is also present in the environment as a result of
  atmospheric nuclear weapons testing in the 1950s and 1960s. Since
  then, these concentrations have steadily declined and are now
  ranging from 2 to 3 Bq/L across Canada.</p>
  <p>Nuclear reactors and tritium processing facilities are also
  sources of controlled releases of tritium.</p>
  <h2>How is tritium in drinking water measured?</h2>
  <p>The amount of tritium in water is measured in becquerels per
  litre (Bq/L). The effect of the radioactivity on the body is
  calculated in millisieverts (mSv).</p>
  <p>A becquerel is a unit for measuring radioactive decay or
  radioactivity. It is a standard unit used internationally to
  measure radioactivity in nuclear substances, including
  tritium.</p>
  <div class="alert alert-info">
    <p><strong>Amount of tritium in water is measured in
    Bq/L</strong></p>
    <p>The unit (Bq/L) measures the radioactivity associated with
    tritium in the water.</p>
    <p><strong>Effect of tritium on the body is measured in
    mSv</strong></p>
    <p>The unit (mSv) measures the effect of the radioactivity on
    the whole body.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Every radioactive substance has a different effect on the
  human body. The radiation dose tells us the effect the radiation
  has on the body.</p>
  <p>The standard unit to calculate the radiation dose is the
  sievert (Sv). However, the Sv is a large unit, so the regulators
  and the industry use the millisievert (mSv), which is equivalent
  to 0.001 Sv.</p>
  <p>The radiation dose is used by the CNSC to set the safety level
  limits for the public.</p>
  <p>In order to calculate the annual dose from tritium in drinking
  water, one must take into account:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the tritium concentration in the water (in Bq/L)</li>
    <li>an individual's average daily water consumption
    (assumed)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For an adult, assuming a daily consumption of two litres of
  water, each Bq/L corresponds to a dose of 0.000015 mSv
  annually.</p>
  <p>For an infant, assuming a daily consumption of one litre of
  water, each Bq/L corresponds to a dose of 0.000021 mSv
  annually.</p>
  <div class="alert alert-info">
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>The maximum average annual tritium levels, as measured in
    the municipal drinking water of Canadian communities
    neighbouring nuclear facilities, are about 18 Bq/l.</p>
    <p>If an adult drank two litres of water a day with 18 Bq/L of
    tritium<br>
    for an entire year, that person would receive a dose of 0.00027
    mSv per year<br>
    [18 x 0.000015 mSv = 0.00027 mSv].</p>
    <p>If an infant drank one litre of water a day with 18 Bq/L of
    tritium<br>
    for an entire year, that infant would receive a dose of 0.00038
    mSv per year<br>
    [18 x 0.000021 mSv = 0.00038 mSv].</p>
  </div>
  <h2>What does it mean?</h2>
  <p>The amounts calculated in the example above (0.00027 mSv and
  0.00038 mSv) represent only small fractions of the regulatory
  limit of 1 mSv. The low doses are attributable to the
  implementation of CNSC requirements to keep doses as low as
  reasonably achievable (ALARA).</p>
  <p>Studies have shown that the minimum chronic dose causing
  negative health effects is 100 mSv. The regulatory limit of 1 mSv
  is, therefore, equivalent to 1 percent of this amount.</p>
  <p>To put this amount (1 mSv) in context, let's look at the
  different sources of radiation to which typical Canadians are
  exposed to: background radiation and radiation from medical
  procedures (like X-rays and CT scans).</p>
  <p>The annual dose linked to background radiation in Canada is
  about <a href=
  "http://rpd.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/108/3/215">1.8
  mSv</a>. It is worth noting that background levels vary across
  the country, depending on altitude and radon concentrations. For
  example, the annual background radiation dose for someone living
  in Toronto has been estimated at 1.6 mSv per year, but a similar
  estimate for Winnipeg was 4.0 mSv per year, due to the higher
  radon concentrations in homes.</p>
  <p>Background radiation is mainly due to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>naturally occurring radioactive minerals like uranium and
    thorium, including radon gas (a product of the natural decay of
    uranium)</li>
    <li>cosmic radiation</li>
    <li>fallout from the nuclear weapons testing in the 1950s and
    1960s (in steady decrease)</li>
    <li>other naturally-occurring and man-made radioisotopes</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Medical procedures account for about 1.2 mSv on average. It is
  also worth noting that this figure varies from person to person,
  depending on the number of radiological diagnosis and
  treatments.</p>
  <p>The 0.00027 mSv dose, as related to the consumption of
  drinking water containing 18 Bq/L (seen in our example above) is
  insignificant compared to the dose from background radiation and
  medical procedures.</p>
  <p>The figure below illustrates the radiation dose related to
  different sources.</p>

  <h2>How are tritium levels in drinking water regulated and
  monitored?</h2>
  <h3>Drinking water quality</h3>
  <p>Canadian provinces have control over the regulations for the
  quality of the drinking water, including setting limits for
  tritium levels.</p>
  <p>Provincial authorities and municipalities have monitoring
  programs to control water quality, including tritium levels.</p>
  <p>Nuclear power plant operators, as well as AECL's facility in
  Chalk River, have monitoring programs in place to sample and
  report tritium concentrations in drinking water.</p>
  <p>Other nuclear facilities, such as tritium processing
  facilities, have their own environmental monitoring programs to
  keep tritium levels under control.</p>
  <p>Health Canada recommends 7,000 Bq/L as the maximum amount of
  tritium in drinking water. Some provinces, such as Ontario, have
  adopted this value as a legal standard.</p>
  <p>Health Canada's guideline is based on the recommendations of
  the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP)
  and the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
  <p>On June 9, 2009, the ODWAC proposed to the Ontario Ministry of
  Environment to lower the enforceable limit of tritium in drinking
  water from 7,000 Bq/L to 20 Bq/L.</p>
  <p>It is worth noting that tritium levels in the municipal
  drinking water of the communities near nuclear facilities in
  Canada are well below national and international standards, and
  below the new 20 Bq/L limit proposed by the ODWAC.</p>
  <p>Tritium levels in the municipal drinking water of these
  communities vary between 6.4 and 18 Bq/L, and therefore do not
  result in any significant exposure of the public to
  radiation.</p>
  <div class="alert alert-info">
    <p><strong>The ALARA principle</strong></p>
    <p>Refers to the requirement to keep exposures "as low as
    reasonably achievable"</p>
    <p><strong>How much tritium is a Terabecquerel
    (TBq)?</strong></p>
    <p>A terabecquerel (TBq) represents one million, million
    (10<sup>12</sup>) becquerels (Bq). A Bq is a measure of the
    amount of radioactivity but has little to do with the weight or
    volume of the material.</p>
    <p>For example, a Bq of tritium has the same activity as a Bq
    of uranium. However, the weight of one Bq of tritium is about
    1/10,000,000,000th of a Bq of uranium-238. This is because
    tritium has a much shorter half-life than uranium (12.3 years
    compared to 4.5 billion years).</p>
    <p>A Bq of tritium weighs 2.8 X 10<sup>-15</sup> grams, or 2.8
    femtograms (fg) and a TBq of pure tritium would weigh 0.003
    grams. Of course, one never gets pure tritium. Tritium's most
    common form is HTO, or tritiated water. So a TBq of tritiated
    water would weigh about 0.02 grams.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>Releases to the environment</h3>
  <p>The CNSC requires nuclear facility operators to closely
  monitor and report tritium releases into the environment. The
  releases of tritium into the environment are controlled, and do
  not pose a health risk.</p>
  <p>The CNSC sets the limit for the radiation dose for the public
  arising from the activities of nuclear facilities at 1&nbsp;mSv
  per year. In addition, to minimize the environmental impact of
  tritium releases, the CNSC uses the ALARA principle, which means
  that licensees are required to keep exposures "as low as
  reasonably achievable".</p>
  <p>All authorized releases to the environment - known as derived
  release limits (DRLs) - are calculated using a methodology that
  considers the various ways in which radionuclides, such as
  tritium, can impact members of the public.</p>
  <p>For instance, the methodology must take into account the
  impact of tritium releases on locally-grown food, water supply
  and air quality. The methodology used is conservative and
  assumes, for instance, that individuals live, work and stay in
  their community for extended periods of time.</p>
  <p>DRLs are specific to each facility and take into account
  various regional factors such as meteorological and geographical
  conditions as well as the population density near the
  facility.</p>
  <p>As an example, Ontario Power Generation's Pickering B nuclear
  power plant has a DRL of about 490,000 Terabecquerels (or 4.9 X
  10<sup>17</sup> Bq) for tritium liquid emissions. However, with
  the implementation of controls based on ALARA their actual annual
  release in 2008 was about 200 TBq, about 0.04 percent of the
  DRL.</p>
  <p>Action levels (ALs) are set as a condition of the licence and
  licensees must report any release above these levels to the CNSC.
  ALs represent a small fraction of the DRLs (0.05 percent) and are
  rarely reached during the year.</p>
  <p>The CNSC's approach to regulating tritium releases into the
  environment has provided strong protection for the quality of the
  drinking water of the communities near nuclear facilities.</p>
  <p>As an example, Figure 2, below, presents levels of tritium in
  four drinking water supply plants on the Ottawa River downstream
  of AECL's Chalk River Laboratories.</p>

    <p><sup>1</sup>The EU does not use this number as a limit, but
    rather as a screening value to indicate the possible presence
    of other artifical radionuclides.</p>
  </figure>
  <p>In other countries, the enforceable drinking water standards
  for tritium vary between 740 Bq/L (US) and 76,103 Bq/L
  (Australia).</p>
  <p>In the European Union (EU), requirements for radioactivity in
  drinking water are not mandatory but only used as indicators to
  trigger further investigation. The EU tritium indicator value of
  100 Bq/L is used as a screening value, automatically triggering
  an investigation if reached.</p>
  <p>In 2006, California adopted a non-mandatory public health goal
  of 14.8&nbsp;Bq/l for tritium in drinking water.</p>
  <p>The observed concentrations of tritium in the drinking water
  in Canada are below and slightly above California's non-mandatory
  health goal and below the limit of 20 Bq/L recommended by the
  ODWAC.</p>
  <p>Considering the very low concentrations of tritium in drinking
  water in Canada, the CNSC concludes that health risks to the
  population are insignificant.</p>
  <p>The CNSC tracks tritium levels continuously to ensure the
  protection of the public and the environment. The organisation is
  committed to protecting the health of Canadians and will continue
  to do so by drawing on the best domestic and international
  practices.</p>

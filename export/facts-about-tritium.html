  <h2>What is tritium?</h2>
  <p>Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. It has the same
  number of protons and electrons as hydrogen but has 2 neutrons,
  whereas regular hydrogen does not have any. This makes tritium
  unstable and radioactive. Tritium is produced naturally from
  interactions of cosmic rays with gases in the upper atmosphere,
  and is also a by-product of nuclear reactors.</p>
  <p>Like all radioactive isotopes, tritium decays. As it decays,
  it emits beta radiation.</p>
  <p>The physical half-life of tritium is 12.33 years, meaning that
  it takes just over 12 years for tritium to decay to half of its
  original amount. As tritium decays, it changes to helium.</p>
  <h2>Uses</h2>
  <p>Tritium can be combined with phosphor to create
  glow-in-the-dark lighting such as exit signs, emergency lighting
  in buildings, and airport runway lights.</p>
  <p>It is also used as a tracer in biomedical research to study
  and diagnose heart disease, cancer and AIDS.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In the future, it may also be used to generate electricity in
  fusion reactors.</p>
  <p>Where does tritium go?</p>
  <p>Small amounts of tritium are released to the environment,
  mostly from reactor operation and maintenance and during the
  manufacture of tritium light sources.</p>
  <h2>In water</h2>
  <p>The most common form of tritium is tritiated water, which is
  formed when a tritium atom replaces a hydrogen atom in water
  (H<sub>2</sub>O) to form HTO.</p>
  <p>HTO has the same chemical properties as water and is odourless
  and colourless.</p>
  <p>Tritiated water has a biological half-life of 10 days, but in
  the body, a small amount binds to proteins, fat and carbohydrates
  with an average 40-day half-life.</p>
  <h2>In food</h2>
  <p>Some of the tritium released into the environment can get into
  nutrients such as carbohydrates, fats or proteins. Tritium
  consumed in food (organically bound tritium) poses a slightly
  greater health risk, as the body retains it longer than tritiated
  water. This means the tritium atom is more likely to decay while
  in the body, possibly damaging cells. The body can repair this
  type of damage on its own.</p>
  <h2>Health effects</h2>
  <p>Tritium is a relatively weak source of beta radiation, which
  itself is too weak to penetrate the skin. However, it can
  increase the risk of cancer if consumed in extremely large
  quantities.</p>
  <p>Tritium can enter the body through inhalation, ingestion or
  absorption through the skin. Most tritium leaves the body as
  tritiated water in urine, in breath as moisture and through
  perspiration. Most inhaled tritiated hydrogen gas is exhaled
  immediately.</p>
  <h2>Protecting you</h2>
  <p>The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) sets limits on
  the releases of tritium and requires all Canadian nuclear
  operators to conduct and report on their environmental
  monitoring.</p>
  <p>The highest average annual tritium level measured in the
  drinking water of Canadian communities near nuclear facilities is
  about 18 becquerels per litre (Bq/L), well below Health Canada’s
  recommended drinking water limit of 7,000 Bq/L.</p>

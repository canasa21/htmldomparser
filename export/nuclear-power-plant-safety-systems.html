  <p>Each nuclear power plant in Canada has multiple, robust safety
  systems designed to prevent accidents, and reduce its effects
  should one occur. All of these systems are maintained and
  inspected regularly, and upgraded when necessary, to ensure
  plants meet or exceed strict safety standards established by the
  Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. The systems perform three
  fundamental safety functions: controlling the reactor, cooling
  the fuel and containing radiation.</p>

  <h2><a id="R1"></a>How a nuclear power plant works</h2>
  <h3>The reactor</h3>
  <p>All nuclear power plants in Canada use the CANDU design - a
  safe, reliable, reactor technology.</p>
  <p>CANDU reactors produce electricity through a process known as
  fission. Fission is the process of splitting atoms of natural
  uranium inside the reactor, releasing radiation and heat.</p>
  <p>The split atoms then continue a “chain reaction”: more atoms
  continue to be split, resulting in more radiation and heat.</p>
  <p>The heat - energy - is harnessed to make steam to power the
  turbines and generators, which in turn produce electricity.</p>
  <div style="height:auto;width:595px;color:#666;">

      "This image shows the heat from the fission reaction is used to produce electricity. "
      height="142" width="595">
    </figure>
  </div>
  <h3>Used nuclear fuel pool</h3>
  <p>After the uranium, or nuclear fuel, has been used in the
  reactor, it is removed and stored securely in a pool for a period
  of 6 to 10 years.</p>
  <p>The water in the pool continues to cool the fuel and provides
  shielding against radiation.</p>
  <p>All of Canada's fuel pools are built in ground, in separate
  buildings at the nuclear power plant, and are designed to
  withstand earthquakes<em>.</em></p>

  <h2><a name="R2" id="#R2"></a>Controlling the reactor</h2>
  <h3>Normal operation</h3>
  <p>Controlling the reactor involves increasing, decreasing or
  stopping the chain reaction happening inside the reactor.</p>
  <p>When the reactor is operating, the chain reaction (or power
  level) is controlled by moving adjuster rods and varying the
  water level in vertical cylinders.</p>
  <p>Sensitive detectors constantly monitor different aspects, like
  temperature, pressure and the reactor power level.</p>
  <p>When necessary, CANDU reactors can safely and automatically
  shut down within seconds.</p>
  <h3>Shutdown systems</h3>
  <p>All nuclear power reactors in Canada have two independent,
  fast-acting and equally effective shutdown systems.</p>
  <p>The first shutdown system is made up of rods that drop
  automatically and stop the chain reaction if something irregular
  is detected.</p>
  <p>The second system injects a liquid, or poison, inside the
  reactor to immediately stop the chain reaction.</p>
  <p>Both systems work without power or operator intervention.
  However, they can also be manually activated.</p>
  <p>These systems are regularly and safely tested.</p>

  </div><br>
  <h3>Restarting the reactor</h3>
  <p>Once a CANDU reactor is shut down, it will stay that way until
  restarted by the operators in the control room.</p>
  <p>There is no possibility of the reactor accidentally restarting
  on its own after it's shut down. The reactor must be manually
  restarted. This is another important safety feature.</p>
  <p class="text-right"><a href="#wb-main">Top of page</a></p>
  <h2><a id="R3"></a>Cooling the fuel</h2>
  <h3>Decay heat</h3>
  <p>Following shutdown, the amount of energy produced by the
  reactor decreases rapidly.</p>
  <p>The nuclear fuel will, however, continue to produce some heat
  and must be cooled.</p>
  <p>That heat, called decay heat, represents a small fraction of
  the heat produced during normal operation.</p>

  </div>
  <h3>Main cooling systems</h3>
  <p>Fuel cooling involves three main systems:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the heat transport system</li>
    <li>the steam system</li>
    <li>the condenser cooling system</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The <strong>heat transport system</strong> brings the heat
  produced by the reactor to the steam generators.</p>
  <p>This system is made up of very robust pipes, filled with heavy
  water - a rare type of water found in nature. Pipes and other
  components are maintained and inspected regularly, and replaced
  if necessary.</p>
  <p>Inspections include measuring pipe wear and tear and
  identifying any microscopic cracks or changes well before they
  become a problem.</p>
  <h4>Quick fact</h4>
  <p>On average, one out of 7,000 drops of water is heavy water. It
  is 10% heavier than regular water because it includes a heavy
  form of hydrogen called deuterium.</p>
  <div style="height:auto;width:595px;color:#666;">

      <figcaption class="image-caption">

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
  <p>The second system, the <strong>steam system</strong>, uses
  normal water. The heat from the reactor turns this water into
  steam to run the turbines and generators.</p>
  <div style="height:auto;width:595px;color:#666;">

      <figcaption class="image-caption">

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
  <p>That steam is then cooled and condensed using a third system
  that pumps in cold water from a body of water such as a lake or
  reservoir. This is called the <strong>condenser cooling
  system</strong>.</p>
  <p>Like other components, the steam and condenser cooling systems
  are regularly inspected.</p>
  <p>These inspections take place throughout the life of the
  nuclear facilities to confirm that aging equipment is functioning
  as originally designed.</p>

    </figure>
  </div><br>
  <h3>Shutdown cooling system</h3>
  <p>A simpler cooling system is used when the reactor is shut down
  for an extended period, for example during a planned outage.</p>
  <p>It requires little power to function and is connected directly
  to the heat transport system. It allows the primary coolant
  system to be partly drained to perform inspection and maintenance
  work (e.g., inspection of the steam generator tubes or
  replacement of pump components).</p>
  <h3>Multiple power supplies</h3>
  <p>Cooling systems need electricity to operate. Under normal
  operation, they get their electricity from the same power grid as
  the rest of us.</p>
  <p>Nuclear power plants in Canada are also equipped with multiple
  sources of backup power if they get disconnected from the
  grid.</p>
  <p>Sources of backup power include onsite power - that is, the
  power produced by the plant itself.</p>
  <p>In addition, the following are available:</p>

  </ul>
  <p>Some plants include even more equipment.</p>
  <p>You can learn more by watching what would happen in the very
  unlikely event of a <a href=

  total station blackout</a> – the situation that led to the
  Fukushima accident following the large tsunami that destroyed all
  available power sources onsite.</p>
  <h3>Natural circulation</h3>
  <p>One of the inherent and proven safety features of CANDU
  reactors is their ability to cool the reactor through natural
  circulation.</p>
  <p>In CANDU reactors, natural circulation takes over when the
  pumps that normally push the coolant through the heat transport
  system stop functioning.</p>
  <p>For natural circulation to continue over time, steam
  generators need to be filled with cool water.</p>
  <h4><em>How does it work?</em></h4>
  <p>This cooling feature of CANDU reactors works because of the
  difference in temperature and elevation between the steam
  generators (cooler and physically higher than the reactor core)
  and the reactor core (hotter and lower than the steam
  generators)</p>
  <h3>Emergency injection systems</h3>
  <div class="col-md-3 pull-right">
    <figure class="module-poster">
      <img src="./images/nuclear-power-plant-safety-systems-10.jpg"

      <figcaption class="image-caption">
        Emergency pressurized nitrogen tanks
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
  <p>In the unlikely event of a loss of heavy water, which could,
  for example, be caused by a pipe break, the emergency injection
  system would ensure water continues to circulate over the
  containers holding the fuel to cool it.</p>
  <p>They would do this by working with pressurized tanks of
  nitrogen or pumps.</p>
  <p>A collection basin located in the basement of the reactor
  building would recover the water and pump it back into the
  reactor until repairs could be made.</p>
  <h3>Emergency mitigation equipment</h3>

        generator
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
  <p>As one of the actions mandated by the CNSC following the
  Fukushima accident, nuclear power plant operators in Canada have
  been acquiring emergency mitigation equipment, such as portable
  power generators and pumps, which could be used to bring reactors
  to a safe shutdown state during a severe accident.</p>
  <p>The equipment, located onsite and offsite, is easily
  transported and could be used in several ways.</p>
  <p>For instance, it could be used to stabilize reactors, supply
  power to the control room and add water to the used nuclear fuel
  pools so they could continue cooling the used nuclear fuel.</p>
  <p class="text-right"><a href="#wb-main">Top of page</a></p>
  <h2><a id="R4"></a>Containing radiation</h2>
  <h3>Containment layers</h3>
  <p>Nuclear reactors are built with multiple barriers to safely
  contain radiation.<br></p>
  <p>At the heart of all CANDU reactors are hardened ceramic
  pellets made of natural uranium.</p>
  <p>These pellets contain the radiation. They form the first layer
  of containment.</p>
  <p>The pellets are enclosed in rods, which form the second layer
  of containment. CANDU fuel rods are made of zircaloy, a metal
  alloy extremely resistant to heat and corrosion.</p>
  <p>The rods are then loaded into pressure tubes, which are part
  of the heat transport system. This is the third layer of
  containment.</p>
  <p>The pressure tubes are contained inside a metal tank called
  the calandria, which itself is contained inside a thick vault
  made of reinforced concrete.</p>
  <div style="height:auto;width:595px;color:#666;">
    <figure class="module-poster">
      <img src="./images/nuclear-power-plant-safety-systems-12.png"
      alt=
      "The image shows different layers of radiation containment, which include the fuel pellet, fuel rod and pressure tube. "
      height="418" width="595">
    </figure>
  </div>
  <p>The fourth layer of containment is the building that houses
  and protects the reactor.</p>
  <p>The walls of the reactor building are made of at least one
  metre of reinforced concrete.</p>
  <p>The reactor building is surrounded by an exclusion (buffer)
  zone.</p>
  <h3>Minimizing radiation releases</h3>
  <p>During normal operation, nuclear power plants release very
  small amounts of radiation into the air and water.</p>
  <p>These releases come from the reactor and its system and from
  waste management activities.</p>
  <p>In order to reduce airborne releases, highly efficient filters
  and radiation monitors are installed as part of the ventilation
  systems.</p>
  <p>Filters remove over 99% of the radiation from the air before
  it is released to the environment.</p>
  <p>Similar systems are also installed to remove radioactivity
  from waterborne releases.</p>
  <div class="col-md-3 pull-right">

      <figcaption class="image-caption">

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
  <p>These releases usually come from wash water used to clean
  surfaces, floors and laundry, as well as from water draining from
  showers and sinks.</p>
  <p>All radiation releases from nuclear facilities in Canada are
  very small. They are monitored and controlled by the plant
  operator, and reported to the CNSC.</p>
  <p>The release levels are well below regulatory limits and do not
  pose any risk to the health and safety of persons or the
  environment.</p>
  <p>Filtering systems are regularly inspected and power plant
  operators must, by law, report all radioactive releases into the
  environment.</p>
  <h3>Protecting containment in case of an accident</h3>
  <p>Safety systems are in place so that, in case of an accident,
  they can protect the containment from internal pressure due to
  steam releases inside the reactor building.</p>
  <p>In a single-unit station, internal pressure would be lowered
  by spraying water from a dousing tank.</p>

  <p>In a multi-unit station, pressure would be lowered by
  releasing steam and hot gases from the reactor building to the
  vacuum building.</p>
  <p>The vacuum building is a structure specifically designed to
  quickly and safely lower pressure inside the reactor building.
  This building also has a dousing system to control pressure.</p>
  <p>The vacuum and dousing systems work without power and are
  tested periodically under the supervision of CNSC inspectors.</p>

  <p>Hydrogen gas can be produced during a severe accident.
  Hydrogen gas, which is flammable, could cause an explosion and
  damage the containment, as well as to personnel and other parts
  of the plant.</p>
  <p>To deal with the potential hazards of hydrogen gas, most CANDU
  plants are equipped with hydrogen igniters or burners.</p>
  <p>Recently, nuclear power plant operators have begun installing
  passive autocatalytic recombiners.</p>
  <p>These are devices which passively (without need for external
  power) remove hydrogen from the containment and effectively
  reduce the risk of an explosion or fire.</p>

  <title>Positive Void Coefficient of Reactivity and CANDUs</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p><strong><em>A well-understood technical
  aspect</em></strong></p>
  <p>August 28, 2015</p>
  <p>The void coefficient of reactivity – not exactly your dinner
  table discussion topic, and chances are you’ve never heard of it.
  What’s important to know is that it is a well-known
  characteristic that is understood by the Canadian Nuclear Safety
  Commission.</p>
  <p>In nuclear engineering, all nuclear reactors have a void
  coefficient of reactivity – which is the increase or decrease in
  the rate of fission that would occur, and heat generation,
  following a loss of coolant.</p>
  <p>In some reactors, such as pressurized water reactors and
  boiling water reactors, this coefficient is negative. This means
  that the level of energy and heat produced by a reactor following
  a loss of coolant would naturally decrease before shutdown.</p>
  <p>In CANDU reactors, the void coefficient of reactivity is
  positive.</p>
  <h2>How do CANDU reactors ensure safety?</h2>
  <p>CANDU positive void coefficient of reactivity is a
  well-understood design characteristic and specific measures have
  been implemented in the design to ensure safety.</p>

  <p>Every plant in Canada must have two independent, fast-acting
  and automated emergency shutdown systems to stop the reactor in
  case of an emergency:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The first consists of spring-assisted, gravity-driven,
    neutron-absorbing shutoff rods, which drop into the core.</li>
    <li>The second is an injection of a neutron-absorbing liquid,
    containing gadolinium, into the moderator.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition to those emergency systems, there are several
  layers of protection, within and outside the reactor, to contain
  any release of radioactive material in the unlikely event that it
  occurs.</p>
  <p>Nuclear systems and equipment in Canada are designed, built,
  operated and maintained for maximum plant safety. Sophisticated,
  redundant control systems are installed in each reactor unit.</p>
  <p>For instance, the CNSC requires all reactor designs in Canada
  to include backup computer systems, electrical generators and
  tanks of coolant and air, to reduce the risk of potential
  malfunctions of the main systems.</p>

  <p>Since CANDU reactors and the type of reactor involved in the
  1986 Chernobyl incident both have a positive void coefficient of
  reactivity, some people mistakenly think they also share the same
  safety risks.</p>
  <p>For instance, the Chernobyl reactor had only partial
  containment, one shutdown system, and used graphite as a
  moderator, which can burn under certain accident conditions.</p>
  <p>CANDU reactors have operated safely in Canada, and around the
  world, for more than 35 years and do not pose a significant risk
  to the health and safety of Canadians, or to the environment.</p>
  <p>The CNSC has site offices at each of Canada’s nuclear power
  plants, where CNSC experts regularly inspect and analyze
  operations to ensure they are safe.</p>
  <p>The CNSC welcomes questions and comments from all its
  stakeholders. It is committed to its mandate to regulate the
  Canadian nuclear industry to protect Canadians and the
  environment, which includes disseminating scientific information
  to the public about how it carries out its work.</p>

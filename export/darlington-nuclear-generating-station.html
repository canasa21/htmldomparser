  <h3>Tritium removal facility</h3>
  <p>The Darlington site includes a Tritium Removal Facility (TRF)
  designed to minimize the amount of tritium going into the
  environment, as well as reducing the potential radiation exposure
  of workers. The TRF extracts tritium from the heavy water used in
  the reactors. The extracted tritium is then safely stored in
  stainless steel containers within a concrete vault.</p>
  <h3>Ontario Power Generation Darlington new nuclear power plant
  project</h3>
  <p>The Darlington project is for the site preparation,
  construction, operation, decommissioning and abandonment of up to
  four new nuclear reactors at the existing Darlington Site to
  generate approximately 4,800 megawatts of electricity to the
  Ontario grid.</p>

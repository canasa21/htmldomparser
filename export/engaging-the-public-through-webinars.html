      <p>To help reduce the spread of COVID-19, all onsite webinars
      and in-person presentations have been suspended until further
      notice. However, our virtual events and webinars remain
      available.</p>
    </div>
    <p>We offer webinars on specific subjects and projects, led by
    our experts, to inform the public and answer questions on
    topics related to upcoming licensing hearings, or on topics
    like emerging technologies. New webinars will be added
    regularly.</p>
    <p>Through our Meet the Nuclear Regulator webinars, CNSC staff
    are offering interested stakeholders and members of the public
    an opportunity to learn more about various aspects of what and
    how the CNSC regulates.</p>

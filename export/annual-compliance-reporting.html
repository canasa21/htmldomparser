    <p>I can’t open my form in Portable Document Format (PDF). What
    can I do?</p>
    <p><a href="/sites/default/files/acfd-acr-eng.pdf">Class II
    nuclear facilities and prescribed equipment ACR form</a></p>
    <ul>

        <a href="/sites/default/files/nsrd-acr-eng.pdf">Nuclear
        substances and radiation devices licence ACR form</a>

    <p><strong>These forms may be updated from time-to-time, so
    please ensure that you always use the most current version
    available form on the web site.</strong></p>
    <p>Open the ACR document then select the applicable form from
    the drop-down list and click the “Generate Form” btn to apply
    your selection. The ACR forms are customized for the activity
    authorized by the licence. The licensed activity name and
    number (e.g. 812 - industrial radiography), can be found on
    each licence under section IV <em>Licensed Activities</em>.</p>
    <p>If you selected the wrong licensed activity, in order to
    change it, go back to the drop-down list then select the
    correct licensed activity and then click on the “Generate Form”
    btn to create the correct ACR form.</p>
    <p>To request a hard copy of the ACR form, please send your
    request to <a href=
    "mailto:dnsr-info-drsn@cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca">dnsr-info-drsn@cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca</a>.</p>

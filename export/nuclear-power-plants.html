          Oversight Report for Canadian Nuclear Power Generating
          Sites: 2017</a>.
          <p>The CNSC also collaborates with international
          partners, including the International Atomic Energy
          Agency and its foreign counterparts. Every three years,
          the CNSC publishes a comprehensive report as part of the
          <a href=
          "/eng/reactors/power-plants/convention-on-nuclear-safety/index.cfm">
          Convention on Nuclear Safety</a>, following up on its

          nuclear power plants.</p>
          <h3>Did you know?</h3>
          <p>The CNSC requires licensees of major nuclear
          facilities to develop and implement public information
          programs to keep the public in their community informed
          about their nuclear activities and any potential related
          impact on public health and the environment</p>

          New reactor facility projects</a> are being considered in

          <p>When the CNSC receives an application for a new plant,
          its experts work in multidisciplinary teams to undertake
          an environmental assessment and a technical assessment,
          using the same 14 safety and control areas that form the
          basis of any future licensing and regulatory
          oversight.</p>

          <h2 id="DA">Decommissioning activities</h2>
          <p>The CNSC regulates the entire lifecycle of nuclear
          power plants. <a href=
          "/eng/resources/fact-sheets/decommissioning-of-nuclear-power-plants.cfm">
          Decommissioning</a> activities are the actions a licensee
          undertakes at the end of the useful life of the reactor.
          The decision to stop operating and to decommission the
          reactor is taken solely by the licensee.</p>
          <p>The CNSC's role is to ensure that decommissioning
          activities are carried out in accordance with CNSC
          regulatory requirements to ensure protection of the
          workers, the public and the environment, and to implement
          Canada's international commitments on the peaceful use of
          nuclear energy.</p>
          <p>Plans related to the decommissioning of nuclear power
          plants take, on average, 50 years to completely
          implement. As a requirement for obtaining a licence to
          operate a nuclear power plant, the operator must submit a
          decommissioning plan that outlines how the operator plans
          to manage the dismantling of the plant.</p>
          <p>The financial guarantee, which is based on this plan,
          is also used by the CNSC to evaluate how the operator
          will guarantee financing for decommissioning
          activities.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Under a normal operating licence, the operator can
          place the nuclear facility in safe storage, if it so
          wishes, as an initial step to decommissioning.</p>
          <p>The Gentilly-2 Nuclear Power Plant in Bécancour,
          Québec, recently shut down and will soon take this step.
          Units 2 and 3 of the Pickering Nuclear Generating
          Station, Pickering, Ontario, are already in safe
          storage.</p>
          <p>Three prototype nuclear reactors constructed and owned
          by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited were shut down and
          prepared for decommissioning in the 1980s in Rolphton and
          Kincardine, Ontario and in Bécancour <span class=
          "nowrap">(Gentilly-1).</span></p>
          <p>Today, the CNSC continues to license these facilities
          as <a href="/eng/waste/index.cfm#Facilities">waste
          management facilities</a>, which continue to safely store
          radioactive waste onsite. Funding to proceed with the
          decommissioning activities is provided by Canada's
          <a href=
          "http://www.nuclearlegacyprogram.ca/en/sites_en.html">Nuclear
          Legacy Liabilities Program</a>.</p>
          <p>In the future, all radioactive waste will be removed
          from those locations, and decommissioning will eliminate
          any unreasonable risks to health, safety, security and
          the environment. At that point, those facilities will be
          issued abandonment licences to release them from CNSC
          regulatory control.</p>

    <p>Please note that until further notice, all Commission
    proceedings will be held remotely.</p>
    <p>We continue to monitor the pandemic situation and are
    focusing on critical services to ensure nuclear facilities are
    safe and the public and environment are protected.</p>
  </div>
  <p>The Commission holds public meetings for Commission members to
  consider a wide range of topics related to the nuclear regulatory
  process and, in certain cases, to make legislative, policy or
  administrative decisions on matters of particular or general
  application.</p>
  <p>Major facility-specific licensing applications are not
  considered at Commission meetings. They are considered at public
  hearings. For information on the public hearing process, see
  <a href="/eng/the-commission/hearings/index.cfm">Public
  Commission hearings</a>.</p>
  <p>Typically, a Commission meeting includes CNSC staff
  presentations followed by discussions by the <a href=
  "/eng/the-commission/commission-members/index.cfm">Commission
  members</a> on significant development reports, facility or
  industry sector developments or status reports, and mid-term
  licensee performance reports. CNSC staff may also present
  technical briefings on a wide range of subjects related to the
  regulation of the nuclear industry.</p>
  <p>Meetings may also be held “in-camera” (closed session) in
  whole or in part when certain protected information cannot be
  discussed in a public forum. The <a href=
  "http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2000-212/page-1.html">
  <em>CNSC By-laws</em></a> outline the conduct of Commission
  meetings.</p>

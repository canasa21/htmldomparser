<body>
  <p>The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) licensing
  process includes a thorough assessment of the application
  submission and, if the licence is being renewed, a verification
  of the licensee’s compliance performance. All licence
  applications are assessed based on the risk-ranking of the
  proposed licensed use type. Read about the <a href=
  "#CNSCLicensingandComplianceTools">licensing and compliance tools
  that the CNSC uses</a>.</p>
  <p>A licence application goes through the following steps within
  the CNSC:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>entry into our electronic records system</li>
    <li>assessment for relevant cost-recovery fees, if
    applicable</li>
    <li>entry into our licensing database</li>
    <li>technical assessment by a licensing specialist</li>
    <li>quality assurance</li>
    <li>sign-off by a designated officer (if the application and
    the applicant meet all regulatory requirements)</li>
    <li>licence issued and mailed/faxed to licensee</li>
  </ol>
  <h2 id="NewLicenceApplication">New licence application</h2>
  <p>In order to obtain a nuclear substances and radiation devices
  licence, an application must be submitted to the CNSC. The CNSC
  will only issue a licence when the applicant:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>is deemed qualified to carry on the activity that the
    licence will authorize</li>
    <li>has demonstrated that they will protect the health and
    safety of persons and the environment</li>
    <li>has demonstrated that they will maintain national
    security</li>
    <li>has confirmed that they will adhere to international
    obligations to which Canada has agreed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To apply for a licence, please consult REGDOC-1.6.1,
  <em>Licence Application Guide: Nuclear Substances and Radiation
  Devices,</em> version 2 (<a href=
  "/sites/default/files/REGDOC-1-6-1-Licence-Application-Guide-Nuclear-substances-and-Radiation-Devices-version2-eng.pdf">REGDOC-1.6.1,
  version 2 PDF</a>), and fill out the corresponding <a href=

  devices</a>, revision date 2017-05 (PDF).</p>
  <p>To view the costs associated with the licensing process,
  please refer to the CNSC’s cost recovery program.</p>
  <p>If the application received by the CNSC is complete,
  processing time could take up to 80 business days. Applicants
  will be contacted by the CNSC during the licence application
  review process and once a licence is issued.</p>
  <h2 id="FinancialGuarantees">Financial guarantees</h2>
  <p>All licensees are responsible for safely carrying out the
  nuclear activities authorized under their licences, from the
  issuance of the licence up to and including safe termination of
  the licensed activities. A financial guarantee ensures there are
  funds available for the safe termination of licensed activities
  when the licensee is unable to carry this out. Licensees are
  required to provide a financial guarantee to the CNSC.</p>

  <h2>Licence transfer</h2>
  <p>Under certain circumstances – as per the <em>Nuclear Safety
  and Control Act</em> (NSCA), sections 24(2) and 24(4) – the CNSC
  may authorize the transfer of a licence from one licensee to
  another, or to a new licence applicant, provided there has been
  no significant change in the licensed activity. This process is
  intended to simplify the regulatory process for licensees, while
  ensuring that all regulatory requirements are met.</p>
  <p>A request for licence transfer can be triggered by the
  following changes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>change to a corporation’s name and number</li>
    <li>corporate merger</li>
    <li>corporate restructuring</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To request a licence transfer, the existing licensee must
  complete and submit an application form to their CNSC licensing
  officer including the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a copy of the new proof of legal status</li>
    <li>the appropriate applicant authority form, including
    required photo identification</li>
    <li>the request to appoint a new radiation safety officer (RSO)
    form, with associated information, if there has been a change
    in RSO or applicant authority</li>

  <h2 id="LicenceAmendmentRequests">Licence amendment requests</h2>
  <p>During the licence period, certain circumstances may require
  changes to the licence, and a request for amendment must be
  submitted. An amendment is a modification to an existing licence
  in order to change certain information. You are required to
  request an amendment if there is any change in your current
  regulatory program information, equipment or licensed
  activities.</p>
  <p>When requesting an amendment to an existing nuclear substances
  and radiation devices licence, the following details must be
  submitted along with the licence number:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>changes to nuclear substances and/or radiation devices</li>
    <li>changes to the location of use and/or storage</li>
    <li>changes to personnel (licence contact information i.e., RSO
    applicant authority, alternative RSO, etc.)</li>
    <li>changes to policies, programs and procedures</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In order to process a change in corporate name, a copy of a
  legal document showing the change, such as certificate of
  amendment, certificate of amalgamation or certificate of
  incorporation must be submitted to the CNSC with the licence
  amendment.</p>
  <p>For changes to applicant authorities, the CNSC must be
  notified within 15 days in accordance with section 15 of the

  <p>All requests for licence amendments must be made in writing by
  the licensee’s designated signing authority. This can be done by
  fax (613-995-5086) or by contacting a CNSC licensing specialist
  at 1-888-229-2672.</p>
  <p>Processing an amendment to a licence could take up to three
  weeks from the date a completed submission is received.</p>
  <h2 id="RevokingaLicence">Revoking a licence</h2>
  <p>In order to revoke a licence, proof of decommissioning of the
  site or building must be submitted to the CNSC staff before the
  site or building can be released from regulatory control. The
  licensee must ensure that all nuclear substances and radiation
  devices have been removed, and that the contamination levels of
  the site or building do not exceed the limits specified on the
  licence. Licensees must submit documentation showing that any
  nuclear substances and radiation devices formerly in their
  possession have been received by another licensee who is
  authorized to possess these materials.</p>
  <p>In order for an existing CNSC licence to be revoked, a
  licensee must submit a <a href=
  "/pubs_catalogue/uploads/dispos_e.pdf">request for revocation</a>
  (PDF). Once the CNSC determines the information is complete, the
  licence will be revoked and a letter confirming the revocation
  will be sent to the licensee.</p>
  <p>See the <a href=
  "/sites/default/files/nuclear-substances-and-radiation-devices-licences-decommissioning-checklist_eng.pdf">
  CNSC’s decommissioning checklist (PDF)</a> to ensure you are
  following the right steps.</p>
  <h2 id="CNSCLicensingandComplianceTools">CNSC licensing and
  compliance tools</h2>
  <p>CNSC’s Risk Informed Regulatory Program specifies that
  activities with the greatest risk profile will receive the
  greatest regulatory oversight. The following tools allow the CNSC
  to monitor and verify compliance with the <em><a href=
  "https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-28.3/index.html">Nuclear
  Safety and Control Act</a></em> (NSCA), its regulations and the
  licence conditions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Application assessment (desktop
      reviews)</strong><br>
      The CNSC reviews all information provided in the application
      to ensure compliance with the NSCA and the regulations.This
      stage includes the review of a new licence application, an
      amendment request or a renewal application.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="mrgn-tp-md">
      <strong>Annual compliance report (ACR)</strong><br>
      Licensees are required to submit annual reports of the
      activities they performed. Examples of items to report in the
      ACR include:
      <ul>
        <li>transfers, purchase, disposal of nuclear substances and
        radiation devices</li>
        <li>dosimetry information</li>
        <li>inventory</li>
        <li>changes in the radiation protection program</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Annual compliance reports allow licensees to self-report,
      and allow the CNSC to monitor routine compliance indicators.
      ACR forms for your usetype can be downloaded for
      submission.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Type I inspections</strong><br>
    Type I inspections (also known as audit) are in-depth
    examinations of a licensee’s processes and operations and
    typically occur at the licensee’s operational site(s).
    Compliance verification is done through direct observations of
    work activities, a comprehensive review of procedures and
    records, and staff interviews. This type of inspection will
    include the participation of several CNSC staff members, who
    may be onsite for a period of several days. At the end of the
    inspection, the licensee is presented with the preliminary
    findings, and a complete report is sent to the licensee within
    60 days of the inspection. The licensee is given a list of
    non-compliances found, and must provide timelines for
    addressing these findings. Should something be found during the
    inspection that is an imminent threat to health, safety or the
    environment, the NSCA provides inspectors with the power to
    immediately order cessation of these activities.</li>
    <li class="mrgn-tp-md"><strong>Type II inspections</strong><br>
    A Type II inspection is an onsite snapshot of the licensee’s
    operations. These inspections are typically shorter than Type
    I, since extensive interviews are not performed, and data is
    collected mainly through direct observations, measurements and
    reviews of onsite records. At the end of the inspection, the
    licensee is presented with a preliminary report, and a complete
    report is sent to the licensee within 30 days of the
    inspection. The licensee is given a list of non-compliances
    found and must provide timelines for addressing these findings.
    Should something be found during the inspection that is an
    imminent threat to health, safety or the environment, the NSCA
    provides inspectors with the power to immediately order
    cessation of these activities.</li>

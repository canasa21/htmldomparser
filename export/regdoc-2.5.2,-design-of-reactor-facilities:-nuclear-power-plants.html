<title>REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities: Nuclear Power Plants</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Preface</h2> <p>This regulatory document is part of the CNSC's Physical Design series of regulatory documents, which also covers: design of uranium mines and mills; design of fixed radiography installations; design of nuclear substance laboratories and nuclear medicine rooms; and exposure devices. The full list of regulatory document series is included in the back of this document and can be found on the <a href="/eng/acts-and-regulations/regulatory-documents/index.cfm">CNSC's website</a>.</p> <p>REGDOC-2.5.2, <em>Design of Reactor Facilities: Nuclear Power Plants</em>, sets out requirements and guidance for new licence applications for water-cooled nuclear power plants (NPPs or plants). It establishes a set of comprehensive design requirements and guidance that are risk-informed and align with accepted international codes and practices.</p> <p>This document provides criteria pertaining to the safe design of new water-cooled NPPs. All aspects of the design are taken into account, and multiple levels of defence are promoted in design considerations. To the extent practicable, the requirements and guidance provided herein are technology-neutral with respect to water-cooled reactors. An applicant or licensee may put forward a case to demonstrate that the intent of a requirement is addressed by other means and demonstrated with supportable evidence.</p> <p><em>Design of Reactor Facilities: Nuclear Power Plants </em>supersedes RD-337, which was published in 2008. In addition, it implements recommendations from the CNSC Fukushima Task Force Report.</p> <p>To a large degree, this regulatory document represents the CNSC's adoption of the principles set forth by the International Atomic Energy Agency in SSR-2/1, <em>Safety of Nuclear Power Plants: Design</em> as adapted to align with Canadian requirements.</p> <p>This regulatory document considers all licensing phases, as information from the design process feeds into the processes for reviewing an application for a licence to construct an NPP, and other licence applications.</p> <p>This document is intended to form part of the licensing basis for a regulated facility or activity within the stated scope of the document. It is intended for inclusion in licences as either part of the conditions and safety and control measures in a licence, or as part of the safety and control measures to be described in a licence application and the documents needed to support that application.</p> <p>For proposed new facilities: This document will be used to assess new licence applications for reactor facilities.</p> <p>For existing facilities<sup id="fnb1-ref"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fnb1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup>: The requirements contained in this document do not apply unless they have been included, in whole or in part, in the licensing basis.</p> <p>Guidance contained in this document exists to inform the applicant, to elaborate further on requirements, or to provide direction to licensees and applicants on how to meet requirements. It also provides more information about how CNSC staff evaluate specific problems or data during their review of licence applications. Licensees are expected to review and consider this guidance; if they choose not to follow it, they should explain how their selected approach still meets regulatory requirements.</p> <div class="alert alert-info mrgn-bttm-lg"> <p><strong>Important note:</strong> Where referenced in a licence either directly or indirectly (such as through licensee-referenced documents), this document is part of the licensing basis for a regulated facility or activity.</p> <p>The licensing basis sets the boundary conditions for acceptable performance at a regulated facility or activity, and establishes the basis for the CNSC's compliance program for that regulated facility or activity.</p> <p>Where this document is part of the licensing basis, the word &quot;shall&quot; is used to express a requirement to be satisfied by the licensee or licence applicant. &quot;Should&quot; is used to express guidance or that which is advised. &quot;May&quot; is used to express an option or that which is advised or permissible within the limits of this regulatory document. &quot;Can&quot; is used to express possibility or capability.</p> <p>Nothing contained in this document is to be construed as relieving any licensee from any other pertinent requirements.

Purpose</h2> <p>This regulatory document sets out the requirements of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) for the design of new water-cooled nuclear power plants (NPPs, or plants). It establishes a set of comprehensive design requirements and guidance that are risk-informed and align with accepted national and international codes and practices.</p> <h2 id="sec2">2. Scope</h2> <p>This regulatory document deals with a wide variety of topics related to the design of new NPPs. To the extent practicable, this document is technology-neutral with respect to water-cooled reactors, and includes requirements and guidance for:</p> <ol> <li>establishing the safety goals and objectives for the design</li> <li>utilizing safety principles in the design </li> <li>applying safety management principles</li> <li>designing structures, systems and components (SSCs)</li> <li>interfacing engineering aspects, plant features and facility layout</li> <li>integrating safety assessments into the design process</li> </ol> <p>To a large degree, this document represents the CNSC's adoption of the principles set forth in the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) document SSR-2/1<em>, Safety of Nuclear Power Plants: Design</em>, and the adaptation of those principles to align with Canadian practices.</p> <p>It is recognized that specific technologies may use alternative approaches. If a design other than a water-cooled reactor is to be considered for licensing in Canada, the design is subject to the safety objectives, high-level safety concepts and safety management requirements associated with this regulatory document. However, the CNSC's review of such a design will be undertaken on a case-by-case basis.</p> <p>Conventional industrial safety is addressed only from a high-level perspective, with a focus on design requirements that are related to nuclear safety.</p> <h2 id="sec3">3. Relevant Legislation</h2> <p>The provisions of the <em>Nuclear Safety and Control Act</em> (NSCA) and regulations that are relevant to this regulatory document include:</p> <ul> <li>subsection 24(4) of the NSCA prohibits the Commission from issuing, renewing, amending or replacing a licence, unless &quot;in the opinion of the Commission, the applicant (a) is qualified to carry on the activity that the licence will authorize the licensee to carry on; and (b) will, in carrying on that activity, makes adequate provision for the protection of the environment, the health and safety of persons and the maintenance of national security and measures required to implement international obligations to which Canada has agreed&quot;</li> <li>subsection 24(5) of the NSCA authorizes the Commission to include in a licence any term or condition that the Commission considers necessary for the purposes of the NSCA </li> <li>paragraph 3(1)(i) of the <em>General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations</em> stipulates that an application for a licence shall contain, in addition to other information, &quot;&hellip;a description and the results of any test, analysis or calculation performed to substantiate the information included in the application&quot;</li> <li>paragraph 12(1)(f) of the <em>General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations</em> stipulates that every licensee shall, &quot;&hellip;take all reasonable precautions to control the release of radioactive nuclear substances or hazardous substances within the site of the licensed activity and into the environment as a result of the licensed activity&quot;</li> <li>paragraphs 3(b), 5(a), (d), (e), (f), (i) (k) and 6(a), (b), (h), (j), (k) and 7(f) of the <em>Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations</em> stipulate that an application for a licence in respect of a Class I nuclear facility, other than a licence to abandon, shall contain, in addition to other information: <ul> <li>3(b) &quot;plans showing the location, perimeter, areas, structures and systems of the nuclear facility&quot;</li> <li>5(a) &quot;a description of the proposed design of the nuclear facility, including the manner in which the physical and environmental characteristics of the site are taken into account in the design&quot;</li> <li>5(d) &quot;a description of the structures proposed to be built as part of the nuclear facility, including their design and their design characteristics&quot;</li> <li>5(e) &quot;a description of the systems and equipment proposed to be installed at the nuclear facility, including their design and their design operating conditions&quot;</li> <li>5(f) &quot;a preliminary safety analysis report demonstrating the adequacy of the design of the nuclear facility&quot;</li> <li>5(i) &quot;the effects on the environment and the health and safety of persons that may result from the construction, operation and decommissioning of the nuclear facility&quot;</li> <li>5(k) &quot;the proposed measures to control releases of nuclear substances and hazardous substances into the environment&quot;</li> <li>6(a) &quot;a description of the structures at the nuclear facility, including their design and their design operating conditions&quot;</li> <li>6(b) &quot;a description of the systems and equipment at the nuclear facility, including their design and their design operating conditions&quot;</li> <li>6(h) &quot;the effects on the environment and the health and safety of persons that may result from the operation and decommissioning of the nuclear facility&quot;</li> <li>6(j) &quot;the proposed measures to control releases of nuclear substances and hazardous substances into the environment&quot;</li> <li>6(k) &quot;the proposed measures to prevent or mitigate the effects of accidental releases of nuclear substances and hazardous substances on the environment, the health and safety of persons and the maintenance of national security, including measures to <ul> <li>assist off-site authorities in planning and preparing to limit the effects of an accidental release,</li> <li>notify off-site authorities of an accidental release or the imminence of an accidental release,</li> <li>report information to off-site authorities during and after an accidental release,</li> <li>assist off-site authorities in dealing with the effects of an accidental release, and</li> <li>test the implementation of the measures to prevent or mitigate the effects of an accidental release&quot;</li> </ul></li> <li>7(f) &quot;the effects on the environment and the health and safety of persons that may result from the decommissioning and the measures that will be taken to prevent or mitigate those effects&quot;</li> </ul></li> <li>other sections of the <em>Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations</em>, as well as sections of the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em> and the <em>Nuclear Security Regulations</em> that pertain to the design of a new nuclear power plant</li> </ul> <p class="text-right"><a href="#wb-main"><span class="wb-icon-nav-090-alt"></span>Top of page</a></p> <h2 id="sec4">4. Safety Objectives and Concepts</h2> <p>The safety objectives and concepts described in this section apply to an NPP during operation or during an accident.</p> <p>Four common plant states are defined: normal operation; anticipated operational occurrence (AOO); design-basis accident (DBA); and beyond-design-basis accident (BDBA). This document also introduces the plant state &quot;design extension conditions&quot; (DECs), as a subset of BDBAs that are considered in the plant design.</p> <h3 id="sec4-1">4.1 General nuclear safety objective</h3> <p>In support of the NSCA and its associated regulations, the CNSC endorses the objective established by the IAEA that NPPs be designed and operated in a manner that will protect individuals, society and the environment from harm. This objective relies on the establishment and maintenance of effective defences against radiological hazards in NPPs.</p> <p>The general nuclear safety objective is supported by three complementary safety objectives, which deal with radiation protection, the technical aspects of the design, and environmental protection. The technical safety objective is interdependent with administrative and procedural measures that are taken to ensure defence against hazards due to ionizing radiation.</p> <h4 id="sec4-1-1">4.1.1 Radiation protection objective</h4> <p>The radiation protection objective is to provide that during normal operation, or during anticipated operational occurrences, radiation exposures within the NPP or due to any planned release of radioactive material from the NPP are kept below prescribed limits and as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA).</p> <p>Provisions shall be made for the mitigation of the radiological consequences of any accidents considered in the design.</p> <h4 id="sec4-1-2">4.1.2 Technical safety objectives</h4> <p>The technical safety objectives are to provide all reasonably practicable measures to prevent accidents in the NPP, and to mitigate the consequences of accidents if they do occur. This takes into account all possible accidents considered in the design, including those of very low probability.</p> <p>When these objectives are achieved, any radiological consequences will be below prescribed limits, and the likelihood of accidents with serious radiological consequences will be extremely low.</p> <h4 id="sec4-1-3">4.1.3 Environmental protection objective</h4> <p>The environmental protection objective is to provide all reasonably practical mitigation measures to protect the environment during the operation of an NPP and to mitigate the consequences of an accident.</p> <p>The design shall include provisions to control, treat and monitor releases to the environment and shall minimize the generation of radioactive and hazardous wastes.</p> <h3 id="sec4-2">4.2 Application of the technical safety objectives</h3> <p>The NSCA and the technical safety objectives provide the basis for the following criteria and goals:</p> <ul> <li>dose acceptance criteria</li> <li>safety goals</li> </ul> <p>Safety analyses shall be performed to confirm that these criteria and goals are met, to demonstrate effectiveness of measures for preventing accidents, and mitigating radiological consequences of accidents if they do occur.</p> <h4 id="sec4-2-1">4.2.1 Dose acceptance criteria</h4> <p>The acceptance criteria for normal operations are provided in section 6.4.<br /> The committed whole-body dose for average members of the critical groups who are most at risk, at or beyond the site boundary, shall be calculated in the deterministic safety analysis for a period of 30 days after the analyzed event.<br /> This dose shall be less than or equal to the dose acceptance criteria of:</p> <ul> <li>0.5 millisievert (mSv) for any AOO or </li> <li>20 mSv for any DBA</li> </ul> <p>The values adopted for the dose acceptance criteria for AOOs and DBAs are&nbsp;consistent with accepted international practices, and take into&nbsp;account&nbsp;the recommendations&nbsp;of the IAEA and the International Commission on Radiological Protection. </p> <h4 id="sec4-2-2">4.2.2 Safety goals</h4> <h5>Qualitative safety goals</h5> <p>A limit is placed on the societal risks posed by NPP operation. For this purpose, the following two qualitative safety goals have been established:</p> <p>Individual members of the public shall be provided a level of protection from the consequences of NPP operation, such that there is no significant additional risk to the life and health of individuals.</p> <p>Societal risks to life and health from NPP operation shall be comparable to or less than the risks of generating electricity by viable competing technologies, and shall not significantly add to other societal risks.</p> <h5>Quantitative application of the safety goals</h5> <p>For practical application, quantitative safety goals have been established, so as to achieve the intent of the qualitative safety goals. The three quantitative safety goals are:</p> <ol> <li>core damage frequency</li> <li>small release frequency</li> <li>large release frequency</li> </ol> <p>A core damage accident results from a postulated initiating event (PIE) followed by the failure of one or more safety system(s) or safety support system(s). Core damage frequency is a measure of the plant's accident prevention capabilities.</p> <p>Small release frequency and large release frequency are measures of the plant's accident mitigation capabilities. They also represent measures of risk to society and to the environment due to the operation of an NPP.</p> <h5>Core damage frequency</h5> <p>The sum of frequencies of all event sequences that can lead to significant core degradation shall be less than 10<sup>-5</sup> per reactor year.</p> <h5>Small release frequency</h5> <p>The sum of frequencies of all event sequences that can lead to a release to the environment of more than 10<sup>15</sup> becquerels of iodine-131 shall be less than 10<sup>-5</sup> per reactor year. A greater release may require temporary evacuation of the local population.</p> <h5>Large release frequency</h5> <p>The sum of frequencies of all event sequences that can lead to a release to the environment of more than 10<sup>14</sup> becquerels of cesium-137 shall be less than 10<sup>-6</sup> per reactor year. A greater release may require long term relocation of the local population</p> <h5>Guidance</h5> <p>A comprehensive probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) considers the probability, progression and consequences of equipment failures or transient conditions, to derive numerical estimates for the safety of the plant. Core damage frequency is determined by a Level 1 PSA, which identifies and quantifies the sequence of events that may lead to significant core degradation. The small release frequency and large release frequency are determined by a Level 2 PSA, which starts from the results of a Level 1 PSA, analyzes the containment behaviour, evaluates the radionuclides released from the failed fuel, and quantifies the releases to the environment. An exemption for performing a Level 2 PSA is granted if it is shown that core damage frequency in the Level 1 PSA is sufficiency low (i.e., less than the large release frequency limit).</p> <p>Calculations of the safety goals include all internal and external events as per REGDOC-2.4.2, <em>Probabilistic Safety Assessment (PSA) for Nuclear Power Plants. </em>However, aggregation of internal event and other hazard risk metrics performed through simple addition to demonstrate that the risk metrics (core damage frequency, small release frequency and large release frequency) are not exceeded might not be appropriate. It is recognized that when the risk metrics for external events are conservatively estimated, their summation with the risk metrics for internal events can lead to misinterpretation. Should the aggregated total exceed the safety goals, conclusions should not be derived from the aggregated total until the scope of the conservative bias in the other hazards is investigated.</p> <p>Further details on PSAs are contained in section 9.5 of this document and CNSC&nbsp;REGDOC-2.4.2, <em>Probabilistic Safety Assessment (PSA) for Nuclear Power Plants</em>.</p> <h4 id="sec4-2-3">4.2.3 Safety analyses</h4> <p>To demonstrate achievement of the safety objectives, a comprehensive hazard analysis, a deterministic safety analysis, and a probabilistic safety assessment shall be carried out.

Safety Requirements</h2> <h3 id="sec6-1">6.1 Application of defence in depth</h3> <p>The design of an NPP shall incorporate defence in depth. The levels of defence in depth shall be independent to the extent practicable.</p> <p>Defence in depth shall be achieved at the design phase through the application of design provisions specific to the five levels of defence.</p> <h4>Level One</h4> <p>Achievement of Level one defence in depth shall include conservative design and high-quality construction to provide confidence that plant failures and deviations from normal operations are minimized and accidents are prevented.</p> <p>This shall entail careful attention to selection of appropriate design codes and materials, design procedures, equipment qualification, control of component fabrication and plant construction, and use of operational experience.</p> <h4>Level Two</h4> <p>Level two shall be achieved by controlling plant behaviour during and following a postulated initiating event (PIE) using both inherent and engineered design features to minimize or exclude uncontrolled transients to the extent possible.</p> <h4>Level Three</h4> <p>Achievement of Level three defence in depth shall include the provision of inherent safety features, fail-safe design, engineered design features, and procedures that minimize the consequences of DBAs. These provisions shall be capable of leading the plant first to a controlled state, and then to a safe shutdown state, and maintaining at least one barrier for the confinement of radioactive material. Automatic activation of the engineered design features shall minimize the need for operator actions in the early phase of a DBA.</p> <h4>Level Four</h4> <p> Level four shall be achieved by providing equipment and procedures to manage accidents and mitigate their consequences as far as practicable.</p> <p> Most importantly, adequate protection shall be provided for the confinement function by way of a robust containment design. This includes the use of complementary design features to prevent accident progression and to mitigate the consequences of DECs. The confinement function shall be further protected by severe accident management procedures.</p> <h4>Level Five</h4> <p> The design shall provide adequately equipped emergency support facilities, and plans for onsite and offsite emergency response.</p> <h4>Guidance</h4> <p> IAEAINSAG-10, <em>Defence in Depth in Nuclear Safety</em>, provides information regarding the concept and application of defence in depth.</p> <p> Guidance on performing a systematic assessment of the defence in depth can be obtained from the IAEA safety reports series No. 46, <em>Assessment of Defence in Depth for Nuclear Power Plants</em>.</p> <p> The application of defence in depth in the design should ensure the following:</p> <ul> <li>The approach to defence in depth used in the design should ensure that all aspects of design at the SSCs level have been covered, with emphasis on SSCs that are important to safety.</li> <li>The defence in depth should not be significantly degraded if the SSC has multiple functions (e.g., for CANDU reactors, the moderator and end-shield cooling systems may serve the functions of a process system and include the functions of mitigating DECs).</li> <li>The principle of multiple physical barriers to the release of radioactive material should be incorporated in the design; there should be a limited number of cases where there is a reduction in the number of physical barriers (as may be the case where some components carrying radioactive material serve the function of primary coolant barrier and containment), and adequate justification should exist for such design choices.</li> <li>The design (e.g., in safety design guides, management system programs) should provide: <ul> <li>levels of defence in depth that are addressed by individual SSCs</li> <li>supporting analysis and calculation</li> <li>evaluation of operating procedures</li> </ul></li> <li>The safety analysis should demonstrate that the challenges to the physical barriers do not exceed their physical capacity.</li> <li>The structure for defence in depth provisions at each level of defence should be established for a given plant design, and the evaluation of the design from the point of view of maintaining each safety function should be carried out. This evaluation should consider each and every one of the provisions for mitigation of a given challenge mechanism, and confirm that it is well founded, sufficient, feasible, and correctly engineered within the design.</li> <li>Special attention should be given to the feasibility of a given provision and the existence of supporting safety analyses. Deficiencies in the completeness of the supporting safety analyses should be documented and flagged as issues to be queried.</li> </ul> <p>To ensure that different levels of defence are independently effective, any design features that aim to prevent an accident should not belong to the same level of defence as design features that aim to mitigate the consequences of the accident.</p> <p>The independence between all levels of defence should be achieved, in particular, through diverse provisions. The strengthening of each of these levels separately would provide, as far as reasonably achievable, an overall reinforcement of defence in depth. For example, the use of dedicated systems to deal with DECs ensures the independence of the fourth defence level.</p> <h4 id="sec6-1-1">6.1.1 Physical barriers</h4> <p>To ensure the overall safety concept of defence in depth is maintained, the design shall provide multiple physical barriers to the uncontrolled release of radioactive materials to the environment. Such barriers shall include the fuel matrix, the fuel cladding, the reactor coolant pressure boundary, and the containment. In addition, the design shall provide for an exclusion zone.</p> <p>To the extent practicable, the design shall prevent:</p> <ul> <li>challenges to the integrity of physical barriers</li> <li>failure of a barrier when challenged</li> <li>failure of a barrier as a consequence of failure of another barrier</li> <li>the possibility of failure of engineered barriers from errors in operation and maintenance that could result in harmful consequences</li> </ul> <p>The design shall also allow for the fact that the existence of multiple levels of defence does not normally represent a sufficient basis for continued power operation in the absence of one defence level.</p> <h3 id="sec6-2">6.2 Safety functions</h3> <p>The NPP design shall provide adequate means to:</p> <ol> <li>maintain the plant in a normal operational state</li> <li>ensure the proper short-term response immediately following a PIE </li> <li>facilitate the management of the plant in and following DBAs and DECs</li> </ol> <p>The following fundamental safety functions shall be available in operational states, DBAs and DECs, except where the postulated accident involves a loss of that function:</p> <ol> <li>control of reactivity</li> <li>removal of heat from the fuel</li> <li>confinement of radioactive material</li> <li>shielding against radiation</li> <li>control of operational discharges and hazardous substances, as well as limitation of accidental releases</li> <li>monitoring of safety-critical parameters to guide operator actions</li> </ol> <p>These safety functions shall apply to the reactor as well as fuel storage and handling.<br /> SSCs necessary to fulfill safety functions following a PIE shall be identified. This approach shall identify the need for such functions as reactor shutdown, emergency core cooling, containment, emergency heat removal and power systems.</p> <h3 id="sec6-3">6.3 Accident prevention and plant safety characteristics</h3> <p>The design shall apply the principles of defence in depth to minimize sensitivity to PIEs. Following a PIE, the plant is rendered safe by: </p> <ol> <li>inherent safety features</li> <li>passive safety features</li> <li>specified procedural actions </li> <li>action of control systems </li> <li>action of safety systems</li> <li>action of complementary design features</li> </ol> <h3 id="sec6-4">6.4 Radiation protection and acceptance criteria</h3> <p>Achievement of the general nuclear safety objective (discussed in section 4.1) depends on all actual and potential sources of radiation being identified, and on provision being made to ensure that sources are kept under strict technical and administrative control.</p> <p>Radiation doses to the public and to site personnel shall be as low as reasonably achievable. During normal operation, including maintenance and decommissioning, doses shall be regulated by the limits prescribed in the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em>.</p> <p>The design shall include provisions for the prevention and mitigation of radiation exposures resulting from DBAs and DECs.</p> <p>The design shall also ensure that potential radiation doses to the public from AOOs and DBAs do not exceed dose acceptance criteria provided in section 4.2.1. The calculated overall risk to the public shall meet the safety goals in section 4.2.2.</p> <h4>Guidance</h4> <p>A detailed radiation dose assessment should include estimated annual collective and individual effective and equivalent radiation doses to site personnel and members of the public for normal operation, potential radiation doses to the public for AOOs and DBAs, and potential releases into the environment for DECs.</p> <p>The assessment process should be clearfixly documented and should include the process for consideration and evaluation of dose-reduction changes in the NPP design. Radiation doses resulting from the operation of the NPP should be reduced by means of engineered controls and radiation protection measures to levels such that any further expenditure on design, construction and operational measures would not be warranted by the expected reduction in radiation doses.</p> <p>The radiation dose assessment should include the expected occupancy of the NPP's radiation areas, along with estimated annual person-Sievert doses associated with major functions, including radioactive waste handling, normal maintenance, special maintenance, refuelling and in-service inspection. Such assessments should include information as to how ALARA and operating experience are used in the design to deal with dose-significant contributors.</p> <h4>Additional information</h4> <p>Additional information may be found in:</p> <ul> <li>CNSC, G-129, rev. 1, <em>Keeping Radiation Exposures and Doses &quot;As Low as Reasonably Achievable (ALARA)&quot;</em>, Ottawa, Canada, 2004.</li> <li>CSA Group, N288.2, <em>Guidelines for Calculating Radiation Doses to the Public from a Release of Airborne Radioactive Material under Hypothetical Accident Conditions in Nuclear Reactors</em>, Toronto, Canada.</li> </ul> <h3 id="sec6-5">6.5 Exclusion zone</h3> <p>The design shall include adequate provision for an appropriate exclusion zone. The appropriateness of the exclusion zone shall be based on several factors, including:</p> <ol> <li>evacuation needs</li> <li>land usage needs</li> <li>security requirements</li> <li>environmental factors</li> </ol> <h4>Guidance</h4> <p>The exclusion zone for NPPs in Canada has been typically defined as 914&nbsp;metres from the reactor building.&nbsp;Rather than prescribe a particular size for the exclusion zone, this regulatory document specifies factors that must be considered in establishing an appropriate size, including&nbsp;evacuation needs, land usage needs, security requirements and environmental factors.</p> <h4>Evacuation needs</h4> <p>The design should take into account emergency response requirements based on the size of the exclusion zone and the facilities and infrastructures that are within the zone.</p> <p>The exclusion zone boundary should be defined with consideration for the capabilities of onsite and offsite emergency response. Environmental factors which can affect the response times should be taken into consideration. The design also considers projected changes over time in land use and population density, which could adversely affect response times, or the ability to shelter or evacuate persons from both the site itself and associated emergency planning regions.</p> <p>Evacuation needs are generally based on existing provincial nuclear emergency response plans.</p> <h4>Land usage needs</h4> <p>The design should ensure that the exclusion zone is large enough to accommodate the site for the nuclear plant (accounting for the full number of units postulated to be built at the site, whether or not they would be built immediately).</p> <p>The design activities should seek to optimize land usage by the plant as part of determining the exclusion zone.</p> <h4>Security requirements</h4> <p>The design should provide security requirements based on the size of the exclusion zone, the facilities and infrastructures that are within the zone, and the design of the facility. Generally, a larger exclusion zone would require more security capabilities, in order to avoid a longer response time. Physical characteristics of the site itself (which include geographical characteristics, such as proximity to elevated land) also play a role in determining these requirements.</p> <p>The design authority may decide to mitigate these risks while maintaining a smaller exclusion zone, by choosing highly robust facility designs, applying engineered security measures to the site, and having a well-designed security program. These engineered measures should be described.</p> <p>In establishing the radius of the exclusion zone boundary, the design should take into account:</p> <ul> <li>the site selection and threat assessment report </li> <li>facility robustness against natural and human induced external hazards (including malevolent acts)</li> <li>the capability of the onsite security program, along with any offsite security resources that will supplement the onsite security program</li> </ul> <p>In each of the above parameters, the design should take into account projected changes over time in land use and population density, which could adversely affect that parameter. The design should be such that the exclusion zone, as established at the design stage, will be sustainable for the full lifecycle of the facility.</p> <p>The acceptability of the information to be provided in support of the above is discussed in section 7.22 of this document.</p> <h4>Environmental factors</h4> <p>Environmental factors which may have an impact on the size of the exclusion zone include local meteorological conditions which could affect the radiological dose received by members of the public. The design authority may use generic site data using conservative assumptions regarding meteorological conditions in the absence of a specific site.</p> <p>The <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em> establish an effective dose limit of 1 mSv per year for members of the public. This limit implies that a hypothetical member of the public who lives at the exclusion zone boundary for 1 year (since no permanent dwelling is permitted within the exclusion zone) would not accumulate a dose of more than 1 mSv from normal operation of the NPP.</p> <h4>Additional information</h4> <p>Additional information may be found in:</p> <ul> <li>CNSC, RD-346, <em>Site Evaluation for New Nuclear Power Plants</em>, Ottawa, Canada, 2008.</li> </ul> <h3 id="sec6-6">6.6 Facility layout</h3> <p>The facility layout shall take into account PIEs to enhance protection of SSCs important to safety.</p> <p>The design shall take into account the interfaces between the safety, security and safeguards provisions of the NPP and other aspects of the facility layout, such as:</p> <ol> <li>access routes for normal operational actions and maintenance</li> <li>access control to minimize radiation exposures</li> <li>actions taken in response to internal or external events</li> <li>egress routes</li> <li>movement of hazardous substances, nuclear materials, and radioactive materials</li> <li>movement of authorized and unauthorized personnel</li> <li>interaction of building and support functions</li> </ol> <p>It is likely that some design requirements associated with these factors will conflict with others in the determination of facility layout requirements. The design, therefore, shall reflect an assessment of options, demonstrating that an optimized configuration has been sought for the facility layout.</p> <h4 id="sec6-6-1">6.6.1 Requirements for multiple units</h4> <p>The design shall take due account of challenges to multiple units at a site. Specifically, the risk associated with common-cause events affecting more than one unit at a time shall be considered.</p> <h5>Guidance</h5> <p>The presence of multiple units at a site, or common-cause events could exacerbate challenges that the plant personnel would face during an accident. The events and consequences of an accident at one unit may affect the accident progression or hamper accident management activities at the neighbouring unit; available resources (personnel, equipment and consumable resources) would need to be shared among several units. These challenges should be identified and the available resources and mitigation strategies shown to be adequate.</p> <p class="text-right"><a href="#wb-main"><span class="wb-icon-nav-090-alt"></span>Top of page</a></p> <h2 id="sec7">7. General Design Requirements</h2> <h3 id="sec7-1">7.1 Safety classification of structures, systems and components</h3> <p>The design authority shall classify SSCs using a consistent and clearfixly defined classification method. The SSCs shall then be designed, constructed, and maintained such that their quality and reliability is commensurate with this classification.</p> <p>In addition, all SSCs shall be identified as either important or not important to safety. The criterion for determining safety importance is based on:</p> <ul> <li>safety function(s) to be performed</li> <li>consequence(s) of failure</li> <li>probability that the SSC will be called upon to perform the safety function</li> <li>the time following a PIE at which the SSC will be called upon to operate, and the expected duration of that operation</li> </ul> <p>SSCs important to safety shall include:</p> <ul> <li>safety systems</li> <li>complementary design features</li> <li>safety support systems</li> <li>other SSCs whose failure may lead to safety concerns (e.g., process and control systems)</li> </ul> <p>Appropriately designed interfaces shall be provided between SSCs of different classes in order to minimize the risk of having SSCs less important to safety adversely affecting the function or reliability of SSCs of greater importance.</p> <h4>Guidance</h4> <p>The method for classifying the safety significance of SSCs important to safety should be based primarily on deterministic methodologies, complemented (where appropriate) by probabilistic methods and engineering judgment. The safety classification of SSCs should be an iterative process that continues throughout the design process.</p> <p>The SSC classification process should include the following activities:</p> <ul> <li>review and definition of PIEs</li> <li>grouping and identification of bounding PIEs</li> <li>identification of plant-specific safety functions to prevent or mitigate the PIEs </li> <li>safety categorization of the safety functions, in accordance with their safety significance and role in achieving fundamental safety functions</li> <li>identification of SSCs that provide the safety functions</li> <li>assignment of SSCs to a safety class corresponding to the safety category</li> <li>verification of SSC classification </li> <li>identification of engineering design rules for classified SSCs</li> </ul> <p>This approach should be used for all SSCs including pressure retaining components, electrical, instrumentation and control (I&amp;C) and civil structures.</p> <p>The identified PIEs should be grouped into limiting cases, which are referred to as bounding or enveloping PIEs. Once these bounding PIEs are known and understood, the required safety functions can be identified. The number of categories and classes may be chosen to allow for graded design rules.</p> <p>The time following the PIE captures the need for automatic action for short timescales, or manual actions being acceptable for longer-term actions. The expected duration of the operation is also important since some systems may need to operate for months. Others (such as shutdown means) can complete their mission within seconds.</p> <p>The potential severity of the consequences of a function failure should be evaluated. The severity should be based on the consequences that could arise if the function was not performed. The consequences of a function failure should be made assuming that the safety functions belonging to the subsequent level of defence in depth remain functional.</p> <p>Some specific SSCs classification guidelines are given below:</p> <ul> <li>SSCs whose failure cannot be accepted because the failure will result in unacceptable consequences with certainty should be allocated to the highest safety class.</li> <li>Supporting SSCs that are essential to achieve the safety function of the frontline SSCs to be supported should be assigned to the same class as that of the frontline SSCs.</li> <li>An SSC that contributes to the performance of several safety functions of different categories should be assigned to the class corresponding to the highest category of those safety functions requiring the commensurate design rules.</li> <li>Any SSC that is not part of a safety function group, but whose failure could adversely affect this safety function group in accomplishing its safety function (if this cannot be precluded by design) should be classified in accordance with the safety category of that safety function group.</li> <li>Where the safety class of connecting or interacting SSCs is not the same (including cases where one SSC belonging to a safety class is connected to another SSC not important to safety), the interference between the SSCs should be separated by a device (e.g., a physical or optical isolator) classified in the higher safety class. This is to ensure that the failure of a lower safety class SSC will not propagate to an SSC belonging to a higher safety class.</li> </ul> <p>The adequacy of the safety classification should be verified using deterministic safety analysis, which should cover all PIEs and all the credited safety functions. This verification should be complemented, as appropriate, by insight from probabilistic safety assessment and by engineering judgment.</p> <p>The appropriate design rules and limits as indicated in section 7.5 are specified in accordance with the safety class of SSCs.</p> <p>Although the probability of SSCs being called upon during DECs is very low, the failure of safety functions for the mitigation of DECs may lead to consequences with high severity. SSCs that provide these safety functions should be assigned a safety category commensurate with the safety significance. For certain complementary design features (such as onsite portable equipment) with high redundancy and extremely low probability of being called upon, a low safety class may be appropriate. It should be noted that not all portable equipment is included in SSCs important to safety.</p> <p>Firstly, SSCs are identified as important or not important to safety. By virtue of their roles, safety systems, complementary design features and safety support systems will be identified as important to safety. Additionally, other SSCs that can have a significant impact on nuclear safety will also be identified as important to safety.</p> <p>After the SSCs important to safety are identified, they are classified. The safety classification considers a number of factors as listed above. The safety classification enables appropriate design rules to be selected as described in section 7.5</p> <h3 id="sec7-2">7.2 Plant design envelope</h3> <p>The design authority shall establish the plant design envelope, which comprises all plant states considered in the design: normal operation, AOOs, DBAs and DECs, as shown in figure 1.</p> <h4 id="fig1">Figure 1: Plant states</h4> <p><img src="/images/regdoc-241/Plant-states-eng.PNG" alt="Plant states"/></p> <p><a href="/eng/acts-and-regulations/regulatory-documents/published/html/regdoc2-5-2/longdesc.cfm">Figure 1: Text equivalent</a></p> <p>The design basis shall specify the capabilities that are necessary for the plant in operational states and DBAs.</p> <p>Conservative design measures and sound engineering practices shall be applied in the design basis for operational states and DBAs. This will provide a high degree of assurance that no significant damage will occur to the reactor core, and that radiation doses will remain within established limits.</p> <p>Complementary design features address the performance of the plant in DECs.</p> <h4>Guidance</h4> <p>The design basis for each SSC important to safety should be systematically defined and justified. The design should also provide the necessary information for the operating organization to run the plant safely.</p> <p>The design should adopt deterministic design principles of appropriate conservatism. For example, SSCs should be robust, tolerant of a large spectrum of faults with a gradual degradation in their effectiveness, and should not fail catastrophically under operational states, DBAs and DECs.</p> <p>The conditions for deviating from conservative and deterministic design principles should be clearfixly stated, including the basis by which such deviation would be justified on a case-by-case basis; such basis may include a more sophisticated calculation methodology that has been well established, or a multiplicity of ways in which a particular function can be fulfilled.</p> <p>A complementary design feature is a design feature added to the design as a stand-alone SSC (including portable equipment), or added capability to an existing SSC to cope with DECs.</p> <p>The design principles for complementary design features to deal with DECs do not necessarily need to incorporate the same degree of conservatism as those applied to the design up to and including DBAs. However, the design authority should provide reasonable assurance that the complementary design features will function as designed when called upon.</p> <h3 id="sec7-3">7.3 Plant states</h3> <p>Plant states considered in the design shall be grouped into the following four categories: </p> <ol> <li>Normal operation is an operation within specified OLCs, including start-up, power operation, shutting down, shutdown, maintenance, testing, and refuelling.</li> <li>An anticipated operational occurrence (AOO) is a deviation from normal operation that is expected to occur once or several times during the operating lifetime of the NPP but which, in view of the appropriate design provisions, does not cause any significant damage to items important to safety, or lead to accident conditions.</li> <li>Design-basis accidents (DBAs) are accident conditions for which an NPP is designed according to established design criteria, and for which damage to the fuel and the release of radioactive material are kept within regulated limits.</li> <li>Design extension conditions (DECs) are a subset of beyond-design-basis accidents that are considered in the design process of the facility in accordance with best-estimate methodology to keep releases of radioactive material within acceptable limits. Design extension conditions could include severe accidents. </li> </ol> <p>Acceptance criteria shall be assigned to each plant state considered in the design, taking into account the principle that frequent PIEs will have only minor or no radiological consequences, and that any events that may result in severe consequences will be of extremely low probability.</p> <h4>Guidance</h4> <p>Plant states considered in the design are divided into normal operation, AOOs, DBAs and DECs. The design requirements of SSCs should then be developed to ensure that the plant is capable of meeting applicable deterministic and probabilistic requirements for each plant state. Note that the plant states diagram in section 7.2 identifies BDBA as a plant state. However, only a subset of BDBAs is considered in the design. These are DECs.</p> <p>The design should include the following: </p> <ul> <li>criteria for transition to normal operation following an AOO or DBA (e.g., the safety functions are provided, and the OLC limits for the operating configurations are met)</li> <li>key parameters and characteristics for operational states, including nominal values and deviations due to uncertainties and settings of instruments, controls, trips, equipment action time, or due to process fluctuations</li> <li>permissible conditions for different operating configurations (e.g., cold and pressurized) including transient time (e.g., power level of reactor or turbine, normal planned power transient rate, heat-up and cool-down rates) for the NPP's operating life</li> <li>methods of transferring the plant between different operating configurations </li> <li>final safe configurations after AOOs, DBAs, and DECs </li> </ul> <h4 id="sec7-3-1">7.3.1 Normal operation</h4> <p>The design shall facilitate the safe operation of the plant within a defined range of parameters, with an assumed availability of a minimum set of specified support features for safety systems.</p> <p>The design shall minimize the unavailability of safety systems. The design shall address the potential for accidents to occur when the availability of safety systems may be reduced, such as during shutdown, start-up, low power operation, refuelling and maintenance.</p> <p>The design shall establish a set of requirements and limitations for safe normal operation, including:</p> <ul> <li>limits important to safety</li> <li>constraints on control systems and procedures</li> <li>plant maintenance, testing, and inspection requirements to ensure that SSCs function as intended, taking the ALARA principle into consideration</li> <li>clearfixly defined operating configurations, such as start-up, power production, shutdown, maintenance, testing, surveillance, and refuelling - these configurations shall include relevant operational restrictions in the event of safety system and safety support system outages</li> </ul> <p>These requirements and limitations, together with the results of safety analysis, shall form the basis for establishing the OLCs according to which the plant will be authorized to operate, as discussed in section 4.3.3 of this document.</p> <h5>Guidance</h5> <p>The design ensures that normal operations are carried out safely, thereby ensuring that radiation doses to workers and members of the public, as well as any planned discharges and releases of radioactive material from the plant, will be within the prescribed limits specified in the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em>, and will meet the requirements of section 4.1.1 of this regulatory document.</p> <p>Operating configurations for normal operation are addressed by the OLCs which are described in section 4.3.3. These typically include:</p> <ul> <li>normal reactor start-up (from shutdown, through criticality, to full power)</li> <li>power operation, including full-power and low-power operation</li> <li>changes in reactor power, including load-follow modes (if applicable) and return to full- power after an extended period at low-power</li> <li>operation during transition between configurations such as reactor shutdown from power operation (hot shutdown, cool-down) </li> <li>refuelling during normal operation, where applicable</li> <li>shutdown in a refuelling mode or other maintenance condition that opens the reactor coolant or containment boundary</li> <li>handling of fresh and irradiated fuel</li> </ul> <p>The key parameters and unique characteristics of each operational configuration, including the specific design provision for maintaining the configuration, should be identified. The permissible periods of operation at different configurations (e.g., power level) in the event of a deviation from normal operating configurations, should also be identified.</p> <h4 id="sec7-3-2">7.3.2 Anticipated operational occurrences</h4> <p>The design shall include provisions such that releases to the public following an AOO do not exceed the dose acceptance criterion provided in section 4.2.1.</p> <p>The design shall also provide that, to the extent practicable, SSCs not involved in the initiation of an AOO shall remain operable following the AOO.</p> <p>The response of the plant to a wide range of AOOs shall allow safe operation or shutdown, if necessary, without the need to invoke provisions beyond Level 1 defence in depth or, at most, Level 2.</p> <p>The facility layout shall be such that equipment is placed at the most suitable location to ensure its immediate availability when operator intervention is required, allowing for safe and timely access during an AOO.</p> <h5>Guidance</h5> <p>The guidance in this subsection also covers elements common to AOO and DBA.</p> <p>In accordance with the requirements of section 4.3.1 of this regulatory document for Level 2 and Level 3 defence in depth, the design should include the results of the analyses of AOOs and DBAs in order to provide a demonstration of the robustness of the fault tolerance in the engineering design and the effectiveness of the safety systems. The analysis should cover the full range of events over the full range of reactor power. The analysis should also cover all normal operating configurations, including low-power and shutdown states.</p> <p>For a wide range of AOOs, the design should be such that any deviations from normal operation can be detected, and that the control systems can be expected to return the plant to a safe state, normally without the activation of safety systems. For both AOOs and DBAs, there should be high confidence that qualified systems (as identified in REGDOC-2.4.1, <em>Deterministic Safety Analysis</em>) can mitigate the event even when acting alone.</p> <p>In the analysis of AOOs and DBAs for each group of PIEs, it may be sufficient to analyze only a limited number of bounding initiating events, which can represent a bounding response for a group of events. The rationale for the choice of these selected bounding events should be provided. The plant parameters that are important to the outcome of the safety analysis should also be identified. These parameters would typically include:</p> <ul> <li>reactor power and its distribution</li> <li>core component temperatures</li> <li>fuel cladding oxidation, and deformation</li> <li>pressures in the primary and secondary systems</li> <li>containment parameters</li> <li>temperatures and flows</li> <li>reactivity coefficients</li> <li>reactor kinetics parameters</li> <li>reactivity worth of reactivity devices</li> </ul> <p>Those characteristics of the safety systems, including the operating conditions in which the systems are actuated, the time delays, and the systems' capacity after the actuation claimed in the design, should be specified and demonstrated to be consistent with the overall functional and performance requirements of the systems.</p> <h5>Additional information</h5> <p>Examples of AOOs may be found in:</p> <ul> <li>CNSC, REGDOC-2.4.1, <em>Deterministic Safety Analysis, </em>Ottawa, Canada, 2014.</li> </ul> <h4 id="sec7-3-3">7.3.3 Design-basis accidents</h4> <p>The set of DBAs shall set the boundary conditions according to which SSCs important to safety are designed.<br /> The design shall be such that releases to the public following a DBA will not exceed the dose acceptance criterion provided in section 4.2.1.</p> <p>In order to prevent progression to a more severe condition that may threaten the next barrier, the design shall include provisions to automatically initiate the necessary safety systems when prompt and reliable action is required in response to a PIE.</p> <p>Provision shall also be made to support timely detection of, and manual response to, conditions when prompt action is not necessary. This shall include responses such as manual initiation of systems or other operator actions.</p> <p>The design shall take into account operator actions that may be necessary to diagnose the state of the plant and to put it into a stable long-term shutdown condition in a timely manner. Such operator actions shall be facilitated by the provision of adequate instrumentation to monitor plant status, and controls for manual operation of equipment.</p> <p>Any equipment necessary for manual response and recovery processes shall be placed at the most suitable location to allow safe and timely worker access when needed.</p> <h5>Guidance</h5> <p>The design identifies the set of DBAs and associated conditions for which the NPP is designed. This includes such responses as manual initiation of systems, or other operator actions.</p> <p>See also section 7.3.2 of this regulatory document for guidance common to AOOs and DBAs.</p> <h5>Additional information</h5> <p>Examples of DBAs may be found in: </p> <ul> <li>CNSC, REGDOC-2.4.1, <em>Deterministic Safety Analyis, </em>Ottawa, Canada, 2014.</li> </ul> <h4 id="sec7-3-4">7.3.4 Design extension conditions</h4> <p>The design authority shall identify the set of design-extension conditions (DECs) based on deterministic and probabilistic methods, operational experience, engineering judgment and the results of research and analysis. These DECs shall be used to further improve the safety of the NPP by enhancing the plant's capabilities to withstand, without significant radiological releases, accidents that are either more severe than DBAs or that involve additional failures.</p> <p>The design shall be such that plant states that could lead to significant radioactive releases are practically eliminated. For plant states that are not practically eliminated, only protective measures that are of limited scope in terms of area and time shall be necessary for protection of the public, and sufficient time shall be made available to implement these measures.</p> <p>Complementary design features shall be provided to cope with DECs. Their design shall be based on a combination of phenomenological models, engineering judgments, and probabilistic methods.</p> <p>The rules and practices that have been applied to the complementary design features shall be identified. These rules and practices do not necessarily need to incorporate the same degree of conservatism as those applied to the design basis.</p> <p>The design shall identify a radiological and combustible gas accident source term, for use in the specification of the complementary design features for DECs. This source term is referred to as the reference source term and shall be based on a set of representative core damage accidents established by the design authority.<br /> To the extent practicable, the design shall provide biological shielding of appropriate composition and thickness in order to protect operational personnel during DECs.</p> <p>In the case of plants with multiple units at a site, the use of available support from other units shall only be relied upon if the safe operation of the other units is not compromised.</p> <h5>Guidance</h5> <p>DECs are the subset of BDBAs that are considered in the design. BDBAs are all events less frequent than DBAs; there is no lower frequency bound.</p> <p>For identifying DECs, consideration should be given to:</p> <ul> <li>factors of the accident progression (i.e., physical conditions, processes and phenomena)</li> <li>BDBA (including severe accident) scenarios resulting from initiating events, human actions, and SSC operability (success or failure) </li> <li>selection of bounding events that are considered in design and determination of limiting values and ranges of the parameters of these events</li> </ul> <p>The design should identify the features that are designed for use in, or that are capable of preventing or mitigating events considered in DECs. These features include complementary design features and other SSCs that may be credited for DECs. These features should:</p> <ol> <li>be independent, to the extent practicable, of those used in more frequent accidents</li> <li>have a reliability commensurate with the function that they are required to fulfill</li> </ol> <p>The choice of the DECs to be analyzed should be explained and justified, indicating whether it has been made on the basis of a PSA or other analysis that identifies potential vulnerabilities of the plant.<br /> For use in the specification of the complementary design features for DECs, the reference source term should be calculated for a set of representative accident scenarios based on the best-estimate models. This should take into account the uncertainties of key parameters and the possible changes in governing physical processes.</p> <p>Accidents in this category are, typically, sequences involving more than one failure (unless these are taken into account in the DBAs at the design stage). Such sequences may include DBAs with degraded performance of a safety system, and sequences that could lead to containment bypass. The analysis of those accidents may:</p> <ul> <li>use best-estimate models and assumptions</li> <li>take credit for realistic system action and performance beyond original intended functions, including the potential use of safety, non-safety and temporary systems </li> <li>take credit for realistic operator actions</li> </ul> <p>Where this is not possible, reasonably conservative assumptions should be made in which the uncertainties in the understanding of the physical processes being modelled are considered. The analysis should justify the approach taken.</p> <p>Accident conditions with a significant release are considered to have been practically eliminated:</p> <ul> <li>if it is physically impossible for the condition to occur, or</li> <li>if the condition can be considered with a high degree of confidence to be extremely unlikely to arise</li> </ul> <p>Physical impossibility can be demonstrated by a design feature that would preclude initiation or further progress of an accident scenario. Care should be taken when assumptions are used to support the demonstration. Such assumptions should be adequately acknowledged and addressed.</p> <p>To demonstrate practical elimination as extremely unlikely with a high degree of confidence, the following should be considered:</p> <ul> <li>The degree of substantiation provided for the demonstration of practical elimination should take account of the assessed frequency of the situation to be eliminated and of the degree of confidence in the assessed frequency. </li> <li>Practical elimination of an accident should not be claimed solely based on compliance with a probabilistic cut-off value. Even if the probability of an accident sequence is very low, any additional design features, operational measures or accident management procedures to lower the risk further should be implemented to the extent practicable.</li> <li>The most stringent requirements regarding the demonstration of practical elimination should apply in the case of an event with the potential to lead directly to a severe accident; i.e., from Level 1 to Level 4 for defence in depth. For example, demonstration of practical elimination of a heterogeneous boron dilution event in a pressurized water reactor (PWR) would require a detailed substantiation. </li> <li>The necessary high confidence in low likelihood should, wherever possible, be supported by means such as: <ul> <li>multiple layers of protection</li> <li>application of the safety principles of independence, diversity, separation, redundancy</li> <li>use of passive safety features</li> <li>use of multiple independent controls</li> </ul></li> <li>It should be ensured that the practical elimination provisions remain in place and valid throughout the plant lifetime; for example, through in-service and periodic inspections.</li> </ul> <p>In each case, the demonstration should show sufficient knowledge of the accident sequence analyzed and of the phenomena involved, substantiated by relevant evidence.</p> <p>To minimize uncertainties and to increase the robustness of a plant's safety case, demonstration of practical elimination should preferably rely on the criterion of physical impossibility, rather than the second probabilistic criterion (extreme unlikelihood with high confidence).</p> <p>Portable equipment should be classified based on its safety importance.</p> <p>There may be different options available to fulfill the fundamental safety functions during DECs. However, when called upon the portable onsite or offsite equipment credited is expected to be effective with reasonable confidence.</p> <p>Portable onsite or offsite equipment may be one of the means for mitigation in support of the severe accident management guidelines.</p> <h5>Additional information</h5> <p>Examples of BDBAs may be found in:</p> <ul> <li>CNSC, REGDOC-2.4.1, <em>Deterministic Safety Analysis</em>, Ottawa, Canada, 2014.</li> </ul> <h5 id="sec7-3-4-1">7.3.4.1 Severe accidents within design extension conditions</h5> <p>The design shall be balanced such that no particular design feature or event makes a dominant contribution to the frequency of severe accidents, taking uncertainties into account.</p> <p>Early in the design process, the various potential barriers to core or fuel degradation shall be identified, and features that can be incorporated to halt core or fuel degradation at those barriers shall be provided.</p> <p>The design shall also identify the equipment to be used in the management of severe accidents including equipment that is available onsite and offsite.</p> <p>The design shall include redundant connection points to provide for water and electrical power which may be needed to support severe accident management actions.</p> <p>Provisions for testing the equipment shall be provided to the extent practicable.</p> <p>A reasonable level of confidence that this equipment will perform as intended in the case of a severe accident shall be demonstrated by fire and seismic assessments, and consideration of environmental conditions.</p> <p>Consideration shall be given to the plant's full design capabilities, including the possible use of safety, non-safety, and temporary systems, beyond their originally intended function.

In addition, evaluations should be carried out on the capability of complementary design features to cope with DECs. The challenges to the plant presented by such events, and the extent to which the design may be reasonably expected to mitigate their consequences should be considered in establishing the initial severe accident management guidelines which will facilitate meeting the expectations of CNSC REGDOC-2.3.2, <em>Accident Management: Severe Accident Management Programs for Nuclear Reactors</em>.</p> <p> Containment leakage in a severe accident should remain below the design leakage rate limit (as defined in section 8.6.4) for sufficient time to allow implementation of emergency measures. Beyond this time, containment leakage that would lead to exceeding the small and large release safety goals should be precluded. This may be achieved by provision of adequate filtered containment venting along with other features.</p> <p> The design should include the analysis performed for severe accident progression and consequence evaluation including assessments on topical issues, as applicable, such as:</p> <ul> <li>corium stratification</li> <li>thermal-chemical interaction between corium, steel components and vessel</li> <li>heat transfer from corium to vessel or end-shield</li> <li>hydrogen burn</li> <li>steam explosion due to molten fuel-coolant interaction</li> <li>corium-concrete interaction</li> </ul> <p>The results of the severe accident analysis should be taken into account when developing initial severe accident management guidelines and for emergency preparedness.</p> <p> Redundant connection points for water and electrical power which may be needed to support severe accident management actions should use standard connections and be readily accessible. These connection points should also be physically separated, to minimize risks from common-cause events. The design should facilitate the use of equipment and supplies from onsite and offsite locations, such as fuel supply, batteries, onsite and offsite temporary pumps, generators and battery chargers.</p> <h6>Additional information</h6> <p> Additional information may be found in:</p> <ul> <li>CNSC, RD-327, <em>Nuclear Criticality Safety, section 16 - Nuclear Criticality Accident Emergency Planning and Response</em>, Ottawa, Canada, 2010.</li> </ul> <p class="text-right"><a href="#wb-main"><span class="wb-icon-nav-090-alt"></span>Top of page</a></p> <h3 id="sec7-4">7.4 Postulated initiating events</h3> <p>The design for the NPP shall apply a systematic approach to identifying a comprehensive set of postulated initiating events, such that all foreseeable events with the potential for serious consequences or with a significant frequency of occurrence are anticipated and considered.</p> <p> Postulated initiating events can lead to AOOs, DBAs or BDBAs, and include credible failures or malfunctions of SSCs, as well as operator errors, common-cause internal hazards, and external hazards.</p> <p> For a site with multiple units, the design shall take due account of the potential for specific hazards simultaneously impacting several units on the site.</p> <h4>Guidance</h4> <p> The postulated initiating events (PIEs) are identified using engineering judgment and deterministic and probabilistic assessment.

The design should provide assurance that the requirements of CNSC RD/GD-98, <em>Reliability Programs for Nuclear Power Plants</em>, will be met during operation. Not all SSCs important to safety identified in the design phase will necessarily be included in the reliability program.</p> <p> The following principles are applied for SSCs important to safety:</p> <ul> <li>the plant is designed, constructed, and operated in a manner that is consistent with the assumptions and risk importance of these SSCs</li> <li>these SSCs do not degrade to an unacceptable level during plant operations</li> <li>the frequency of transients posing challenges to SSCs is minimized</li> <li>these SSCs function reliably when challenged</li> </ul> <p>The reliability of SSCs assumed in the design stage needs to be realistic and achievable.</p> <p> Deterministic analysis or other methods may be used if the PSA lacks effective models or data to evaluate the reliability of SSCs.</p> <h4 id="sec7-6-1">7.6.1 Common-cause failures</h4> <p>The potential for common-cause failures (CCFs) of items important to safety shall be considered in determining where to apply the principles of separation, diversity and independence so as to achieve the necessary reliability. Such failures could simultaneously affect a number of different items important to safety. The event or cause could be a design deficiency, a manufacturing deficiency, an operating or maintenance error, a natural phenomenon, a human-induced event, or an unintended cascading effect from any other operation or failure within the plant.</p> <h5>Guidance</h5> <p> Failure of a number of devices or components to perform their functions could occur as a result of a single specific event or cause. CCFs could also occur when multiple components of the same type fail at the same time.

In such cases, the reasons for the lack of separation and justification for the space sharing arrangement shall be explained in the design documentation.</p> <p> Where space sharing is necessary, services for safety systems and for other process systems important to safety shall be arranged in a manner that incorporates the following considerations:</p> <ul> <li>A safety system designed to act as backup shall not be located in the same space as the primary safety system.</li> <li>If a safety system and a process system must share space, then the associated safety functions shall also be provided by another safety system in order to counter the possibility of failures in the process system.</li> </ul> <p>The design shall provide effective protection against common-cause events where sufficient physical separation among individual services or groups of services does not exist. The design authority shall assess the effectiveness of specified physical separation or protective measures against common-cause events.</p> <h6>Guidance</h6> <p> Physical separation may be achieved by barriers, distance (both horizontal and vertical) or a combination of the two. For example, the design may provide elevation differences of redundant equipment to protect against flooding.</p> <h5 id="sec7-6-1-2">7.6.1.2 Diversity</h5> <p>Diversity shall be applied to redundant systems or components that perform the same safety function by incorporating different attributes into the systems or components. Such attributes shall include different principles of operation, different physical variables, different conditions of operation, or production by different manufacturers.</p> <p> It is important that any diversity used achieves the desired increase in reliability. For example, to reduce the potential for a CCF, the application of diversity shall be examined for any similarity in materials, components, and manufacturing processes, or subtle similarities in operating principles or common support features. If diverse components or systems are used, there shall be a reasonable assurance that such additions are of overall benefit, taking into account associated disadvantages such as the extra complication in operational, maintenance, and test procedures, or the consequent use of equipment of lower reliability.</p> <h6>Guidance</h6> <p> The design should implement adequate diversity, such as:</p> <ul> <li>design diversity</li> <li>equipment diversity</li> <li>functional diversity</li> <li>human factor engineering diversity</li> </ul> <p>The design for I&amp;C systems should also consider:</p> <ul> <li>signal diversity</li> <li>software diversity</li> </ul> <p>For I&amp;C systems important to safety, it is recommended to use an automated diverse backup system. A manual diverse backup system could be used; its justification should include a human factor engineering analysis.</p> <p> The following diversity strategies should be considered: </p> <ul> <li>different technologies </li> <li>different approaches within the same technology</li> <li>different architectures within the same technology</li> </ul> <p>A diversity and defence in depth analysis should be conducted, to assess design vulnerabilities to CCF. If the defence in depth analysis reveals that certain safety functions could be affected by CCF, the design should provide for a diverse backup system to perform the safety functions affected by the CCF.</p> <h5 id="sec7-6-1-3">7.6.1.3 Independence</h5> <p>Interference between safety systems or between redundant elements of a safety system shall be prevented by means such as electrical isolation, functional independence, and independence of information (e.g., data transfer), as appropriate.</p> <h6>Guidance</h6> <p> Means for providing independence include physical separation, functional independence and independence from the effects of data communication errors. Generally, a combination of these methods should be applied to achieve an acceptable level of independence.</p> <p> Functional independence (such as electrical isolation) should be used, in order to reduce the likelihood of adverse interaction between equipment and components of redundant or connected systems resulting from normal operation or failure of any component in the systems.</p> <p> SSCs important to safety should be independent of the effects of an event to which they are required to respond. For example, an event should not cause the failure or loss of a safety system or safety function that is necessary to mitigate the consequences of that event.</p> <p> Redundant portions of a safety group should be independent from each other, to ensure that the safety group can perform its safety function during (and following) any event that requires that function.</p> <p> The functional failure of the support features of a safety system should not compromise the independence between redundant portions of a safety system, or between a safety system and a system of lower safety classification.</p> <p> The potential for harmful interactions between those SSCs important to safety that might be required to operate simultaneously should be evaluated, and the effects of any harmful interactions should be prevented.</p> <p> In the analysis of the potential for harmful interactions of SSCs important to safety, due account should be taken of physical interconnections, and of the possible effects of one system's operation, maloperation or malfunction on the local environmental conditions for other essential systems. This would ensure that changes in environmental conditions do not affect the reliability of systems or components while functioning as intended.</p> <h4 id="sec7-6-2">7.6.2 Single-failure criterion</h4> <p>All safety groups shall function in the presence of a single failure. The single-failure criterion requires that each safety group can perform all safety functions required for a PIE in the presence of any single component failure, as well as:</p> <ul> <li>all failures caused by that single failure</li> <li>all identifiable but non-detectable failures, including those in the non-tested components </li> <li>all failures and spurious system actions that cause (or are caused by) the PIE</li> </ul> <p>Each safety group shall be able to perform the required safety functions under the worst permissible systems configuration, taking into account such considerations as maintenance, testing, inspection and repair, and equipment outage.</p> <p> Analysis of all possible single failures, and all associated consequential failures, shall be conducted for each component of each safety group until all safety groups have been considered.</p> <p> Unintended actions and failure of passive components shall be considered as two of the modes of failure of a safety group.</p> <p> The single failure shall be assumed to occur prior to the PIE, or at any time during the mission time for which the safety group is required to function following the PIE. Passive components may be exempt from this requirement.</p> <p> Exceptions to the single-failure criterion shall be infrequent, and clearfixly justified.</p> <p> Exemptions for passive components may be applied only to those components that are designed and manufactured to high standards of quality, that are adequately inspected and maintained in service, and that remain unaffected by the PIE. Design documentation shall include justification of such exemptions, by analysis, testing or a combination of analysis and testing. The justification shall take loads and environmental conditions into account, as well as the total period of time after the PIE for which the functioning of the component is necessary.</p> <p>Check valves shall be considered to be active components if they must change state following a PIE.</p> <h5>Guidance</h5> <p>The application of the single-failure criterion (SFC) in design should follow a systematic approach applied to all safety groups. The approach should be adequately verified, such as by using failure modes and effects analysis. The SSCs inside the safety group should include both the primary SSCs and the supporting SSCs.</p> <p>The detectability of failures is implicit in the application of the SFC. Detectability is a function of the system design and the specified tests. A failure that cannot be detected through periodic testing, or revealed by alarm or anomalous indication, is non-detectable. An objective in a single-failure analysis is to identify non-detectable failures. To deal with identifiable but non-detectable failures, the following actions should be considered:</p> <ul> <li>preferred action: the system or the test scheme should be redesigned to make the failure detectable</li> <li>alternative action: when analyzing the effect of each single failure, all identified non-detectable failures should be assumed to have occurred. Therefore, the design should take appropriate measures to address these non-detectable failures, such as adequate redundancy and diversity</li> </ul> <p>Justification in support of an exception to the SFC should consider the consequences of failure, practicality of alternatives, added complexity and operational considerations.

For DECs, relief capacity shall be sufficient to provide reasonable confidence that pressure boundaries credited in severe accident management will not fail.</p> <p> All pressure-retaining SSCs of the reactor coolant system and auxiliaries shall be designed with an appropriate safety margin to ensure that the pressure boundary will not be breached, and that fuel design limits will not be exceeded in operational states, or DBA conditions.</p> <p> The design shall minimize the likelihood of flaws in pressure boundaries. This shall include timely detection of flaws in pressure boundaries important to safety.</p> <p> Unless otherwise justified, all pressure boundary SSCs shall be designed to withstand static and dynamic loads anticipated in operational states, and DBAs.</p> <p> SSC design shall include protection against postulated pipe ruptures, unless otherwise justified.</p> <p> The operation of pressure relief devices shall not lead to significant radioactive releases from the plant.</p> <p> Where two fluid systems operating at different pressures are interconnected, failure of the interconnection shall be considered. Both systems shall either be designed to withstand the higher pressure, or provision shall be made so that the design pressure of the system operating at the lower pressure will not be exceeded.</p> <p> Adequate isolation shall be provided at the interfaces between the reactor coolant system and connecting systems operating at lower pressures, in order to prevent the overpressure of such systems and possible loss-of-coolant accidents. Consideration shall be given to the characteristics and importance of the isolation and its reliability targets. Isolation devices shall be either closed or close automatically on demand. The response time and speed of closure shall be in accordance with the acceptance criteria defined for postulated initiating events.</p> <p> All pressure boundary piping and vessels shall be separated from electrical and control systems to the greatest extent practicable.</p> <p> Pressure-retaining components whose failure will affect nuclear safety shall be designed to permit inspection of their pressure boundaries throughout the design life. If full inspection is not achievable, then it shall be augmented by indirect methods such as a program of surveillance of reference components. Leak detection is an acceptable method when the SSC is leak-before-break qualified.</p> <h4>Guidance</h4> <p> For the design of pressure-retaining systems and components, the design authority should ensure the selection of codes and standards is commensurate with the safety class and is adequate to provide confidence that plant failures are minimized. This is achieved by using industry standards - such as CSA N285<em>, General requirements for pressure-retaining systems and components in CANDU nuclear power plants</em> and ASME <em>Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code</em> - to meet the requirements of different classes of pressure-retaining systems, components, piping and their supports. Alternative codes and standards may be used if this would result in an equivalent or superior level of safety; justifications should be provided in such cases.</p> <p> The design should make provisions to limit stresses and deformation of SSCs important to safety during and after PIEs. The list of PIEs should be comprehensive, and the loads generated by them should be included in the design analysis. The loads generated by these PIEs should be included in the stress analyses required by the design.</p> <p> REGDOC-2.5.2 requires the design to minimize the likelihood of flaws in pressure boundaries. For example, the reactor coolant pressure boundary should be designed with sufficient margin to ensure that, under all operating configurations, the material selected will behave in a non-brittle manner and minimize the probability of rapidly propagating fractures.</p> <p> The pressure boundary components in an NPP almost invariably contain process fluids at very high temperature and pressure. The design should take into account the location of high-energy lines in relation to SSCs important to safety, in order to limit or reduce pipe whip concerns. This includes consideration, where applicable, of items such as:</p> <ul> <li>components in the means of shutdown</li> <li>main coolant pumps</li> <li>headers</li> <li>emergency core cooling system components</li> <li>steam generators</li> <li>steam lines</li> <li>turbine</li> </ul> <h4>Leak-before-break</h4> <p> A qualified leak-before-break (LBB) system design will permit the design authority to optimize protective hardware - such as pipe whip restraints and jet impingement barriers - and to redesign pipe-connected components, their supports and their internals.</p> <p> A qualified LBB methodology should include the following:</p> <ul> <li>LBB should be only applied to high-energy, ASME Code Class 1 or 2 piping or the equivalent. Applications to other high-energy piping may be performed based on an evaluation of the proposed design and in-service inspection requirements.</li> <li>No uncontrolled active degradation mechanism should exist in the piping system to be qualified for LBB.</li> <li>An evaluation of phenomena such as water hammer, creep damage, flow accelerated corrosion and fatigue should be performed to cover the entire life of the high-energy piping systems. To demonstrate that water hammer is not a significant contributor to pipe rupture, reliance on historical frequencies of water hammer events in specific piping systems coupled with reviews of operating procedures and conditions may be used for this evaluation.</li> <li>Leak detection methods for the reactor coolant should ensure that adequate detection margins exist for the postulated through-wall flaw used in the deterministic fracture mechanics evaluation. The margins should cover uncertainties in the determination of leakage from a piping system.</li> <li>Stress analyses of the piping that is considered for LBB should be in accordance with the requirements of section III of the ASME code or equivalent. </li> <li>The LBB evaluation should use design basis loads and, after construction, be updated to use the as-built piping configuration, as opposed to the design configuration.</li> <li>The methodology should take account of potential for degradation by erosion, corrosion, and erosion-cavitation due to unfavourable flow conditions and water chemistry.</li> <li>The methodology should take account of material susceptibility to corrosion, the potential for high residual stresses, and environmental conditions that could lead to degradation by stress corrosion cracking.</li> </ul> <p>In addition, leak detection methods for the reactor coolant should be examined so as to ensure that adequate detection margins exist for the postulated through-wall flaw used in the deterministic fracture mechanics evaluation.</p> <h4>Finite element methods</h4> <p> The design authority customarily uses finite element methods to show that all of the pressure boundary components (both vessels and piping) meet the structural integrity requirements imposed by applicable design codes and standards. When finite element methods are used for design analyses covering all ASME (or equivalent) class components, the design authority should ensure that:</p> <ul> <li>finite element modelling and analysis assumptions are checked to make sure they are justified and conservative</li> <li>finite element mesh is properly refined to account for geometric structural discontinuities with proper element shapes and aspect ratios</li> <li>loads and boundary conditions are correct and properly applied in the finite element models</li> <li>load combinations and scale factors applied to unit load cases conform to design or load specifications</li> <li>linearized stress results, obtained from load combinations, are compared with ASME code (or equivalent) allowable limits</li> </ul> <h3 id="sec7-8">7.8 Equipment environmental qualification</h3> <p>The design shall include an equipment environmental qualification (EQ) program. Development and implementation of this program shall ensure that the following functions can be carried out: </p> <ol> <li>the reactor can be safely shut down and kept in a safe shutdown state during and following AOOs and DBAs</li> <li>residual heat can be removed from the reactor after shutdown, and also during and following AOOs and DBAs</li> <li>potential for release of radioactive material from the plant can be limited, and the resulting dose to the public from AOOs and DBAs can be kept within the dose acceptance criteria </li> <li>post-accident conditions can be monitored to indicate whether the above functions are being carried out</li> </ol> <p>The environmental conditions to be accounted for shall include those expected during normal operation, and those arising from AOOs and DBAs. Operational data and applicable design assist analysis tools, such as the probabilistic safety assessment, shall be used to determine the envelope of environmental conditions.</p> <p> The equipment qualification program for SSCs important to safety shall include the consideration of aging effects due to service life.</p> <p> Equipment qualification shall also include consideration of any unusual environmental conditions that can reasonably be anticipated, and that could arise during normal operation or AOOs (such as periodic testing of the containment leak rate).</p> <p> Equipment and instrumentation credited to operate during DECs shall be demonstrated, with reasonable confidence, to be capable of performing their intended safety function(s) under the expected environmental conditions. A justifiable extrapolation of equipment and instrumentation behaviour may be used to provide assurance of operability, and is typically based on design specifications, environmental qualification testing, or other considerations.</p> <h4>Guidance</h4> <p> The designer should provide detailed processes and specifications for an equipment EQ program, for qualifying safety-related equipment associated with systems that are essential to perform the credited safety functions. The EQ program should address qualification criteria and methods used, and all anticipated environmental conditions upon which the qualification of the equipment (mechanical, electrical, I&amp;C and certain post accident monitoring) is based.</p> <p> The designer should identify the EQ-related standards and codes (e.g., CSA, IEEE and ASME). The latest editions of the applicable standards for use in the equipment qualification are preferred; any deviations should be justified.</p> <p>As a minimum, the basic EQ program elements should be provided as described below.</p> <h4>Identification of equipment requiring harsh environmental qualification</h4> <p> The design should identify:</p> <ul> <li>systems and equipment required to perform safety functions in a harsh environment, including their safety functions and applicable DBAs</li> <li>non-safety-related equipment whose failure due to harsh post-accident environment could prevent safety-related equipment from accomplishing its safety function</li> <li>accident monitoring equipment</li> </ul> <h4>Identification of equipment service conditions</h4> <p> Service conditions should be identified to determine required qualification methods as they apply to various types of qualification (e.g., harsh environments, mild environments, radiation-only harsh environments).</p> <p> The design should provide for:</p> <ul> <li>a distinction between mild and harsh environments (e.g., specific criteria to define plant environments as either mild or harsh)</li> <li>a list of bounding harsh DBAs for qualification of equipment </li> <li>the environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, radiation, humidity, steam, chemicals, submergence) for each applicable DBA to which equipment is exposed in various plant locations</li> <li>temperature, pressure and radiation profiles for harsh environment qualification</li> <li>typical equipment mission time during DBAs </li> <li>mild environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, humidity, radiation) for operational states, including the assumed duration of the AOOs to which equipment is exposed in various plant locations</li> </ul> <h4>Qualification methods</h4> <p> The design should describe methods used to demonstrate the performance of safety-related equipment when subjected to a range of environmental conditions during operational states or DBAs. The methods should determine whether equipment should be qualified for mild or harsh environments.</p> <p> For harsh environment qualification, the design should include the following: </p> <ul> <li>For equipment and components located in a DBA harsh environment, type tests are the preferred method of qualification (particularly for electrical equipment) of qualification; where type tests are not feasible, justification by analysis or operating experience (or a combination of both) may be used. </li> <li>Equipment should be reviewed in terms of design, function, materials and environment, to identify significant aging mechanisms caused by operational and environmental conditions occurring during normal operation. Where a significant aging mechanism is identified, that aging should be taken into account in the equipment qualification.</li> <li>The qualification should systematically address the sequence of age conditioning, including sequential, simultaneous, synergistic effects, and the method for accelerating radiation degradation effects. </li> <li>Appropriate margins, as given in EQ-related standards, should be applied to the specified environmental conditions.</li> <li>For certain equipment (e.g., digital I&amp;C equipment, and new advanced analog electronics) additional environmental conditions - such as electromagnetic interference, radio frequency interference, and power surges - should be addressed.</li> </ul> <p>For mild environment qualification, equipment may be considered qualified, provided that:</p> <ul> <li>the environmental conditions are specified in a design specification</li> <li>the manufacturer provides certification that the equipment meets the specification</li> </ul> <h4>Equipment and instrumentation credited under design extension conditions</h4> <p> A demonstration of equipment and instrumentation operability should include the following:</p> <ul> <li>the accident timeframes for each function</li> <li>the equipment type and location used to perform necessary functions in each timeframe</li> <li>the functions credited in the accident timeframes that need to be performed to achieve a safe shutdown state for DECs</li> <li>the postulated harsh environment of DECs within each timeframe</li> <li>a reasonable assurance that the equipment will survive to perform its function in the accident timeframes, in the DEC environment</li> </ul> <h4>Protective barriers</h4> <p> The design should address protective barriers, if applicable. When protective barriers are designed to isolate equipment from possible harsh environmental conditions, the barriers themselves should be addressed in a qualification program.

Correction of invalid, inauthentic and corrupted functions or data should be applied, to maintain the reliability of systems.</p> <p> Once safety systems&nbsp;are initiated, the reset of safety system functions should require separate operator actions for each system-level function. Deliberate operator action&nbsp;should be required to return the safety systems to normal. However, this&nbsp;should not&nbsp;prevent the use of&nbsp;essential equipment protective devices (such as the protection for electrical or mechanical components) or the provision for deliberate operator interventions (such as trip and isolation of the switchgear). Seal-in of safety system actuation is generally required at system or subsystem level, but not required at individual channel level.</p> <p> The design should provide for the capability to record, store and display historical information, if such displays will help plant staff to identify patterns and trends, understand the past or current state of the system, perform post-accident analysis, or predict future progressions.</p> <p> The design should take into account redundancy, independence, common-cause failure, interaction with other systems, and signal validation, so as to meet the reliability target.</p> <p> When a safety system has been taken out of service for testing or maintenance, clearfix indication should be provided for the duration of testing or maintenance activities.

Additional fire safety provisions are usually assessed and documented in the code compliance, fire hazard assessment and fire safe shutdown analysis, as required by CSA N293.</p> <h3 id="sec7-13">7.13 Seismic qualification and design</h3> <p>The seismic qualification of all SSCs shall meet the requirements of Canadian national or equivalent standards.<br /> The design shall include instrumentation for monitoring seismic activity at the site for the life of the plant.</p> <h4 id="sec7-13-1">7.13.1 Seismic design and classification</h4> <p>The design authority shall ensure that seismically qualified SSCs important to safety are qualified to a design-basis earthquake (DBE), and ensure that they are categorized accordingly. This shall apply to:</p> <ol> <li>SSCs whose failure could directly or indirectly cause an accident leading to core damage</li> <li>SSCs restricting the release of radioactive material to the environment</li> <li>SSCs that assure the subcriticality of stored nuclear material</li> <li>SSCs such as radioactive waste tanks containing radioactive material that, if released, would exceed regulatory dose limits</li> </ol> <p>The design of these SSCs shall also meet the DBE criteria to maintain all essential attributes, such as pressure boundary integrity, leak-tightness, operability, and proper position in the event of a DBE.</p> <p> The design shall ensure that no substantive damage to these SSCs will be caused by the failure of any other SSC under DBE conditions.</p> <p> Seismic fragility levels shall be evaluated for SSCs important to safety by analysis or, where possible, by testing.</p> <p> A beyond-design-basis earthquake (BDBE) shall be identified that meets the requirements for identification of DECs as described in section 7.3.4. SSCs credited to function during and after a BDBE shall be demonstrated to be capable of performing their intended function under the expected conditions. Such demonstration shall provide high confidence of low probability of failure (HCLPF) under BDBE conditions for these SSCs. This demonstration need not be seismic qualification by testing.</p> <h5>Guidance</h5> <p> The seismic design of an NPP should account for:</p> <ul> <li>technical safety objectives and corresponding load categories</li> <li>seismic input motion</li> <li>seismic classification </li> <li>structural layout criteria</li> <li>seismic analysis and design of structural systems, subsystems and equipment</li> <li>seismic testing and instrumentation</li> </ul> <p>Design and beyond design load categories are defined to demonstrate structural performance in operational states, DBAs and DECs. In addition, beyond design load categories are considered for structural performance in DECs. Earthquake load is not part of the normal load category corresponding to normal operation. Site design earthquake load, according to the CSA N289 series on seismic design and qualification, is defined under the severe load category corresponding to AOO. A DBE is defined as a part of the abnormal or extreme load category corresponding to DBA. BDBE load should be considered under DECs.</p> <p> Seismic input motion, derived from the DBE, should be based on seismicity and geologic conditions at the site and expressed in such a manner that it can be applied for the qualification of SSCs. The DBE is defined by multiplying the mean site specific uniform hazard spectrum with a probability of occurrence of 10-4/yr by a design factor, defined in the standard ASCE 43-05, <em>Seismic Design Criteria for Structures, Systems and Components in Nuclear Facilities.</em> The probability of occurrence of the defined DBE is therefore equivalent to the probability of DBAs. A minimum seismic input motion, consistent with national or international standards, should be considered in the design phase for the DBE. The minimum seismic input motion should take into account frequencies of interest for SSCs.</p> <p> Structural layout criteria, including structural separation, should follow best engineering practices and lessons learned from past earthquakes.</p> <p> Modelling of soil-structure interaction (SSI) should be based on geotechnical investigation and taking into account the random nature of soil material properties and inherent uncertainties incorporated in soil constitutive models used in the analysis. To account for uncertainties in soil properties a range with at least three values (upper limit, best estimate and lower limit) should be taken into account in the analysis according to CSA N289.3, <em>Design procedures for seismic qualification of nuclear power plants,</em> clause 5.2.3.</p> <p> The analysis of SSI should take into account all effects due to kinematic interaction (effect of applied seismic ground motion on massless structure) and inertial interaction (inertial forces developed in the structure due to the seismic ground motion). The detail and sophistication of soil-structure models should be in accordance with the purposes of the analyses. The frequency range of interest determines aspects of the structure model and the SSI model parameters.</p> <p> The frequency range of interest should be based on the combination of the frequency range of the earthquake input, the soil properties, the frequency range of building response (including response of subsystems modelled in the main building or structure model), and the frequency range of the response parameter of interest. Refined finite element meshes and increased analytical rigor are required to transmit higher frequencies through the analytical models.</p> <p> Damping ratios for structural systems and sub-systems should be taken into account according to recognized standards such as ASCE 43-05 and CSA N289.3. For generating the in-structure response spectra to be used as input to the structure mounted systems and components, Response Level 1 damping of the structure is more appropriate unless the structure response generally exceeds demand over capacity factor given in ASCE 43-05.</p> <p> The seismic design of structural systems should be categorized according to seismic design category (SDC) 1 to 5 as per ASCE 43-05.</p> <p> SDC 1 and 2 structural systems should be in accordance with the <em>National Building Code of Canada, </em>Division B, Part 4. According to the Code, SDC 1 should be as normal and SDC 2 as post-disaster.</p> <p> All structures important to safety are classified as SDC 5. However, the designer may still classify some structures as SDC 3, 4 and 5 provided that they include proper justification. Guidance on SDC 3, 4 and 5 (if SDC 3 and 4 are used) structural systems are provided as follows:</p> <ul> <li>for concrete containment, the design should be based on the American Society of Civil Engineers, ASCE 43-05 (SDC 5, limit state D) and CSA N287.3, <em>Design Requirements for Concrete Containment Structures for CANDU Nuclear Power Plants</em></li> <li>for steel containment, the design should be based on ASCE 43-05 (SDC 5), 2010 ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section III: Rules for Construction of Nuclear Power Plant Components, Division 1, Subsection NE: Class MC Components and U.S. NRC Regulatory Guide 1.57, <em>Design Limits and Loading Combinations for Metal Primary Reactor Containment System Components</em></li> <li>for concrete and steel safety related structures the design should be based on ASCE 43-05 (SDC 5, limit state D) and CSA N291, <em>Requirements for Safety-Related Structures for CANDU Nuclear Power Plants</em></li> </ul> <p>For all safety design categories in an NPP, ductility requirements should be in accordance with CSA-A23.3, <em>Design of Concrete Structures</em> for concrete structures and CSA S16, <em>Design of Steel Structures</em>&nbsp;for steel structures assuming that the structures are ductile or type D. These ductility requirements should provide margins for the BDBE.</p> <p> Sub-system analysis should follow the guidance presented for structural systems with the following criteria specific to sub-system supports:</p> <ul> <li>in-structure response spectra</li> <li>in-structure time response histories</li> </ul> <p>The methods of defining in-structure response spectra or in-structure time-histories as well as application of this seismic input to sub-systems and components should be in accordance with ASCE 04, <em>Seismic Analysis for Safety-Related Nuclear Structures</em>.</p> <p> Multiple support seismic input of sub-systems and components should take into account their inertial and kinematic components. The analysis should follow ASCE 04 or CSA N289.3, <em>Design procedures for seismic qualification of nuclear power plants.</em></p> <p> Determination of the number of earthquake cycles for sub-system analysis should be in accordance with U.S. NRC NUREG-0800, Standard Review Plan, section 3.7.3,<em> Seismic Subsystem Analysis</em> as well as seismic analysis of above-ground tanks.</p> <p> Seismic design of sub-systems and components should be in accordance with ASCE 43-05 section 8.2.3 which follows ASME Code.</p> <p> For equipment qualified by testing, multi-axis, multi-frequency testing is acceptable for the DBE in accordance with the requirement of IEEE 344-2004 - <em>IEEE Recommended Practice for Seismic Qualification of Class 1E Equipment for Nuclear Power</em> <em>Generating Stations</em> and that the testing response spectrum should be at least a factor of 1.4 times the required response spectrum throughout the frequency range. Any deviation from this should be conservatively justified on a case-by-case basis.</p> <p> Any evaluation for BDBE should utilize the methodology in the Electrical Power Research Institute, (EPRI) TR-103959, <em>Methodology for Developing Seismic Fragilities </em>to determine if a HCLPF goal is met. <br /> Seismic instrumentation design should follow CSA-N289.5, <em>Seismic</em> <em>Instrumentation Requirements for Nuclear Power Plants and Nuclear Facilities </em>which itemizes the requirements for single and multiple unit site seismic instrumentation.</p> <p> Beyond-design-basis margin should be such that seismically induced SSC failure probabilities do not contribute to the total core damage frequency and small and large release frequency to the extent that they do not meet the safety goals. To support meeting the safety goals, the acceptance criterion for BDBE should demonstrate that the plant HCLPF is at least 1.67 times the DBE.</p> <p> Assessment and validation of margins for beyond-design-basis earthquakes should be considered, including the metric HCLPF.</p> <p> The seismic isolation of SSCs is an acceptable design approach to limit seismic demand. Seismic isolation devices should be designed, manufactured and installed to withstand a seismic action defined by a DBE without any failure, preserving its mechanical resistance and full load bearing capacity during and after the earthquake. Moreover, the devices and the whole structural system should be designed to withstand a BDBE up to 2 times the spectral accelerations of the DBE without major damage and preserving its function. It includes the provisions to accommodate the structural displacements up to 2 times the displacements under DBE conditions.</p> <h5>Additional information</h5> <p> Additional information may be found in:</p> <ul> <li>American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/American Nuclear Society (ANS) Standard 2.26, <em>Categorization of Nuclear Facility Structures, Systems, and Components for Seismic Design</em>, La Grange Park, Illinois, reaffirmed 2010.</li> <li>American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), 04-98, <em>Seismic Analysis of Safety-Related Nuclear Structures</em>, Reston, Virginia, 2000.</li> <li>ASCE/Structural Engineering Institute, 43-05, <em>Seismic Design Criteria for Structures, Systems and Components in Nuclear Facilities</em>, Reston, Virginia, 2005.</li> <li>American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section III, Division 1- Subsection NE, <em>Rules for Construction of Nuclear Facility Components</em>, New York, 2010. </li> <li>CSA Group, N287 series on requirements for concrete containment structures for CANDU nuclear power plants.</li> <li>CSA Group, N289 series on seismic design and qualification of nuclear power plants.</li> <li>CSA Group, A23.3, <em>Design of Concrete Structures</em>, Toronto, Canada.</li> <li>CSA Group, S16, <em>Design of Steel Structures</em>, Toronto, Canada. </li> <li>CSA Group, N291, <em>Requirements for Safety-Related Structures for CANDU Nuclear Power Plants</em>, Toronto, Canada.</li> <li>Electric Power Research Institute, TR-103959, <em>Methodology for Developing Seismic Fragilities</em>, Palto Alto, California, 1994.</li> <li>European Standard, EN-15129, <em>Anti-seismic Devices</em>, European Committee for Standardization: Brussels, 2009. </li> <li>European Standard, EN-1337-3, <em>Structural Bearings - Elastomeric Bearings</em>, European Committee for Standardization: Brussels, 2000.</li> <li>European Standard, EN 1337-1, <em>Structural Bearings - General Design Rules</em>, European Committee for Standardization: Brussels, 2000.</li> <li>IEEE, 344, <em>IEEE Recommended Practice for Seismic Qualification of Class 1E Equipment for Nuclear Power Generating Stations</em>, Piscataway, New Jersey, 2004.</li> <li>NRC, <em>National</em><em> Building Code of Canada</em>, Ottawa, Canada, 2010.</li> <li>U.S. NRC, Regulatory Guide 1.57, <em>Design Limits and Loading Combinations for Metal Primary Reactor Containment System Components</em>, Washington, D.C., 2007.</li> <li>U.S. NRC, Regulatory Guide 1.91, <em>Evaluations of Explosions Postulated to Occur on Transportation Routes Near Nuclear Power Plants</em>, Washington, D.C., 1978.</li> <li>U.S. NRC, NUREG-0800, section 3.7.3, <em>Standard Review Plan for the Review of Safety Analysis Reports for Nuclear Power Plants: LWR edition- Seismic Subsystem Analysis</em>, Washington, D.C., 2007.</li> </ul> <h3 id="sec7-14">7.14 In-service testing, maintenance, repair, inspection and monitoring</h3> <p>In order to maintain the NPP within the boundaries of the design, the design shall be such that the SSCs important to safety can be calibrated, tested, maintained and repaired (or replaced), inspected, and monitored over the lifetime of the plant.</p> <p> These activities shall be performed to standards commensurate with the importance of the respective safety functions of the SSCs, with no significant reduction in system availability or undue exposure of the site personnel to radiation.</p> <p> SSCs that have shorter service lifetimes than the plant lifetime shall be identified and described in the design documentation.</p> <p> In cases where SSCs important to safety cannot be designed to support the desirable testing, inspection, or monitoring schedules, one of the following approaches shall be taken:</p> <ol> <li>Proven alternative methods, such as surveillance of reference items, or use of verified and validated calculation methods, shall be specified.</li> <li>Conservative safety margins shall be applied, or other appropriate precautions shall be taken, to compensate for possible unanticipated failures.</li> </ol> <p>Details of alternate approaches to SSC monitoring shall be provided in the design documentation.</p> <p> The design shall provide facilities for monitoring chemical conditions of fluids, and of metallic and non-metallic materials.

Relevant and proven systematic analysis techniques shall be used to address human factors issues within the design process.</p> <p>Human factors considerations:</p> <ol> <li>reduce the likelihood of human error as far as reasonably achievable</li> <li>provide means for identifying the occurrence of human error, and methods by which to recover from such an error</li> <li>mitigate the consequences of error</li> </ol> <p>The human factors engineering program shall also facilitate the interface between the operating personnel and the plant by promoting attention to plant layout and procedures, maintenance, inspection, training, and the application of ergonomic principles to the design of working areas and working environments.</p> <p>Appropriate and clearfix distinction between the functions assigned to operating personnel and those assigned to automatic systems shall be facilitated by systematic consideration of human factors and the human-system interface. This consideration shall continue in an iterative way throughout the entire design process.</p> <p>The human-system interfaces in the main control room, the secondary control room, the emergency support facilities, and in the plant, shall provide operators with necessary and appropriate information in a usable format that is compatible with the necessary decision and action times.</p> <p>Human factors verification and validation plans shall be established for all appropriate stages of the design process so as to confirm that the design adequately accommodates all necessary operator actions.</p> <p>To assist in the establishment of design criteria for information display and controls, each operator shall be considered to have dual roles: that of a systems manager (including responsibility for accident management) and that of an equipment operator. Verification and validation activities shall be comprehensive, such that the design conforms to human factors design principles and meets usability requirements.</p> <p>The design shall identify the type of information that facilitates an operator's ability to readily:</p> <ol> <li>assess the general state of the plant, whether in operational states, DBAs or DECs </li> <li>confirm that the designed automatic safety actions are being carried out</li> <li>determine the appropriate operator-initiated safety actions to be taken</li> </ol> <p>The design shall provide the type of information that enables an equipment operator to identify the parameters associated with individual plant systems and equipment, and to confirm that the necessary safety actions can be initiated safely.<br /> Design goals shall include promoting the success of operator action with due regard for the time available for response, the physical environment to be expected, and the associated psychological demands made on the operator.<br /> The need for operator intervention on a short time scale shall be kept to a minimum. Where such intervention is necessary, the following conditions shall apply:</p> <ol> <li>the information necessary for the operator to make the decision to act is presented simply and unambiguously</li> <li>the operator has sufficient time to make a decision and to act</li> <li>following an event, the physical environment is acceptable in the main control room or in the secondary control room, and in the access route to the secondary control room</li> </ol> <h4>Guidance</h4> <p>This section applies to the design of all plant systems where there are human factors (HF) considerations. Human factors means &quot;factors that influence human performance&quot;, as defined in CNSC P-119 <em>Policy on Human Factors</em>. In practice, it is expected that most plant systems will require some consideration of HF.</p> <p>The systematic approaches and processes taken for HF in design should meet international standards and good practices. HF codes and standards that are used by the design authority for the plant design should be identified and evaluated for their suitability, applicability, sufficiency and adequacy.</p> <p>There should be sufficient authority in the management of HF in design to ensure that HF considerations that influence safety are adequately taken into account. HF design requirements that will supplement the codes (e.g., concerning usability and human performance) should also be identified and specified early in the design stage process.</p> <p> The following areas should have interfaces with HF in design:</p> <ul> <li>engineering design of specific SSCs</li> <li>procedure development</li> <li>training development</li> <li>consideration of human actions in safety analyses</li> <li>specifications of staffing and minimum shift complement</li> </ul> <p>The design expectations are provided below for use in different design stages.</p> <h4>Planning</h4> <p> A human factors engineering program plan demonstrates how HF considerations are incorporated into the design activities. Further guidance on how to develop such a plan is provided in the CNSC G-276 <em>Human Factors Engineering Program Plans</em> and U.S. NRC NUREG-0711, Revision 2, <em>Human Factors Engineering Program Review Model</em>. The technical elements described in the plan should be supported by subsequent verification and validation activities for the resulting design, as described in CNSC G-278 <em>Human Factors Verification and Validation Plans</em>.</p> <p> The HF in design activities are effectively integrated in the overall engineering design process and incorporated early enough to make an effective contribution to safety. There should be a sufficient number of trained, qualified and experienced HF specialists to carry out the HF in design activities provided that established criteria pertaining to system complexity and importance to safety are met.</p> <h4>Analysis</h4> <p> Systematic analytical approaches are used to establish the HF inputs. Such analyses should be conducted from the earliest stages of design, to provide a strong foundation upon which the design solutions are based. The specific HF analyses should be:</p> <ul> <li>appropriate to the activities in question that they cover, considering the risk of the activities and the novelty of the design</li> <li>carried out throughout the development of the design</li> <li>use methods, techniques, and good practices that are considered acceptable by trained and experienced human factors specialists</li> <li>share the information produced between groups engaged in different parts of the design</li> </ul> <p>The HF analyses could include:</p> <ul> <li>function analysis </li> <li>task analysis </li> <li>human reliability analysis</li> <li>hazard analysis</li> <li>link analysis </li> <li>information requirements analysis</li> <li>staffing analysis</li> <li>usability analysis</li> <li>operability and maintainability analysis</li> </ul> <p>The design should also provide research or study reports for any work carried out as part of the process of developing and testing any human-system interface technologies (e.g., displays and controls) that are new to NPP applications and that may have a bearing on safety.</p> <p> The design should demonstrate that steps have been taken in developing the design to reduce or eliminate, where practicable, the potential for human error; that there are acceptable means by which to identify error; that methods are provided by which to recover from the error; and that the consequences of error can be mitigated.</p> <h4>Design</h4> <p> There should be evidence that a systematic process exists for the design of work areas, work environments, and human-system interfaces for SSCs throughout the plant. The design should demonstrate consideration of HF issues for all aspects of the plant, not just control areas. HF aspects should be considered where off-the-shelf SSCs are specified and procured. Operating experience concerning HF issues gained from existing or similar systems should be considered in the design.</p> <p> A significant aspect of this systematic process is the use of modern human factors codes, standards, and good practices in developing the design. Guidance is provided in U.S. NRC NUREG-0700 Revision 2, <em>Human-System Interface Design Review Guidelines</em>.</p> <p> The design should demonstrate that operators (and any other potential users) in the main control room, the secondary control room, the emergency support facilities, and in the plant, are provided with the necessary and appropriate information in a format that is compatible with necessary decision and action times. The same kind of considerations should apply to other users of equipment (e.g., maintainers and technicians) elsewhere in the plant.</p> <h4>Operating personnel</h4> <p> Personnel who have operating experience from similar plants should be actively involved in the design process to ensure that consideration is given as early as possible to the future operation and maintenance of the SSCs.</p> <p> Formal interfaces should be defined between the HF in design group(s) and the various design engineering groups involved in the design process; this facilitates the interactions and sharing of information to achieve good integration of HF considerations in the design.</p> <h4>Verification and validation</h4> <p> Evaluations are an essential part of HF in the design process and include both verification and validation activities. Evaluation criteria (i.e., design requirements and standards) should be established prior to conducting these evaluations.</p> <p> HF verification activities should be carried out (generally by vendor and licensee) to confirm that the design conforms to HF design standards and has been implemented as intended in the plant.</p> <p> Validations should be carried out iteratively at various stages of the design process, ensuring that the task fidelity is appropriate.

More severe but unlikely threats are referred to as beyond-design-basis threats (BDBTs). Both types of threats shall be considered in the design.</p> <p> Threats identified as DBTs shall have credible attributes and characteristics of potential insider or external adversaries, who might attempt unauthorized removal of nuclear material or sabotage against which a physical protection system is designed and evaluated.</p> <p> BDBTs are threats too unlikely to warrant incorporation into the design basis, but for which the consequences shall be assessed in order to establish means of mitigation to the extent practicable.</p> <p> Consistent with the concept of defence in depth, the design shall provide multiple barriers for protection against malevolent acts, including physical protection systems, engineered safety provisions, and measures for post-event management, as appropriate. The failure of a preceding barrier shall not compromise the integrity and effectiveness of subsequent barriers.</p> <p><strong>Guidance</strong></p> <p> The identification of vital areas involves the identification and location of SSCs that require protection, in order to prevent significant radioactive releases. The vital areas include the reactor building and the spent fuel pool, including the structure housing the spent fuel pool. The protection measures for these identified vital areas should be assessed.</p> <p> Based on identified threats, the DBT and BDBT sets of load cases should be selected. Each load case selected should be the worst case scenario for a given threat.</p> <h4 id="sec7-22-2">7.22.2 Design methods</h4> <p>The design authority shall develop a methodology for assessing the challenges imposed by DBTs and evaluating the capabilities for meeting these challenges (e.g., as identified in an initial threat and risk assessment). The methodology shall apply conservative design measures and sound engineering practices.</p> <p> The plant design shall take into account the role of structures, pathways, equipment, and instrumentation in providing detection, delay, and response to threats.</p> <p> Vital areas shall be identified and taken into account in the design and verification of robustness. For vital areas, the design shall allow enough delay for effective intervention by the onsite or offsite response force, taking structures, detection and assessment into account. These areas shall, to the extent practicable, be protected from inadvertent damage while performing defensive actions.</p> <p> The design shall provide appropriate means for access control and detection, and for minimizing the number of access and egress points to protected areas. Such points shall include storm sewers, culverts, service piping, and cable routing that could be used to gain access to the facility.</p> <p> The design shall also take into account the placement of civil utilities to minimize access requirements for such activities as repair and maintenance, in order to reduce threats to the protected area and vital areas.</p> <p> The design authority shall also develop a methodology for assessing the challenges associated with BDBTs.</p> <p>This methodology shall be applied to determine the margins available for shutdown, fuel cooling and confinement of radioactivity. Significant degradation of engineering means may be permitted.</p> <h5>Guidance</h5> <p> Vital areas are designed according to the tiered approach related to the level of the threat as described below.</p> <p> For the loadings induced by DBT, the structural design methodology applies conservative design measures and sound engineering practices that meet codes and standards.</p> <p> For the first-tier BDBT (events more severe than DBT), sufficient structural integrity to protect important systems should be provided. The design code criteria may be relaxed; however, the design methodology should be followed.</p> <p> For the second-tier BDBT (extreme events), degradation of the containment barrier may be accepted; however, the degradation should be limited. The structures of vital areas should be designed for the second-tier BDBT that may exceed design code limits but within documented material and structural limits.</p> <p> The aircraft crash loading functions related to DBTs and BDBTs are &quot;classified&quot;, and are available to licensees and applicants upon request to the CNSC.</p> <p> It is acceptable to model the whole aircraft as a load that impacts the structure. However, the design should be such that the loading functions due to the crash of the modelled aircraft against a rigid target envelope are acceptable.</p> <p> Two distinct types of structural failure modes should be reviewed: local (punching - brittle) failure and global (flexural-plastic) failure. The loading characteristics and structural behaviour for these two failure modes are different, and should be reviewed separately. However, it should be noted that, in some cases, these two failure modes (e.g., an aircraft crash) may act simultaneously or quasi-simultaneously.</p> <p> Local structural behaviours under a malevolent-act-induced loading case should be assessed. Local damage to the target can be defined using the following descriptions:</p> <ul> <li>penetration - the depth of the crater due to the missile impact</li> <li>spalling - the ejection of the target material from the front face of the target (impacted face)</li> <li>scabbing - the ejection of material from the rear face of the target</li> <li>just perforation - the missile just penetrates the target with residual velocity equal to zero </li> </ul> <p>Most technical references consider engines, in the case of an aircraft crash, as the critical missiles.</p> <p> Such local damage modes would not, in general, result in structural collapse; but they may cause damage to safety-related systems or components. Application of empirical formulae for perforation and scabbing is an acceptable approach to assess structural behaviour under local, concentrated loading.</p> <p> Global structural response effects refer to the overall building behaviour in response to the applied impact loading. The global response can be characterized by major structural damage, such as significant perforation or collapse of large portions of the building walls, floors, and load carrying frames. The impact could also potentially induce significant vibrations or &quot;shock loading&quot; throughout the building.</p> <p> In the case of an aircraft crash, in the absence of adequate design measures, local damage associated with the impact of a missile into the wall could result in scabbing of concrete from the rear face. Ultimately, it could result in local fracture of rebar, allowing perforation of the wall by the residual crushed engine mass and remaining portion of the shaft. Global structural damage, however, is generally associated with the deformation of the entire structural system. Adequate design measures should be provided to meet the acceptance criteria provided in section 7.22.3.</p> <p>The design of the facility's physical protection system should consider changes in threat, enhanced understanding of the potential vulnerabilities of the facility, its systems and structures as well as advances in physical protection approaches, systems, and technologies.</p> <h4 id="sec7-22-3">7.22.3 Acceptance criteria</h4> <p>All safety system functions and capabilities shall continue to be available for DBTs.</p> <p> The design shall provide for the ongoing availability of fundamental safety functions during BDBTs; these provisions will depend on the severity of the threat.</p> <p> For more severe events, there shall be a safe shutdown path that comprises at least one means for each of the following:</p> <ol> <li>reactor shutdown</li> <li>fuel cooling</li> <li>retention of radioactivity from the reactor</li> </ol> <p>There shall be sufficient structural integrity to protect important systems. Two such success paths shall be identified where practical.</p> <p> For extreme events, there shall be at least one means of reactor shutdown and core cooling. Degradation of the containment barrier may allow the release of radioactive material; however, the degradation shall be limited. In these cases, the response shall include onsite and offsite emergency measures.</p> <h5>Guidance</h5> <p> The acceptance criteria for both local and global behaviour should be satisfied simultaneously.</p> <p> The structural acceptance criteria for local behaviour should include the following:</p> <ul> <li>For DBTs, there should be no scabbing of the rear face of structural elements, possibly with limited, easily repairable, superficial spalling of concrete. </li> <li>For severe BDBTs, there should be no scabbing of the rear face of structural element, or possible limited scabbing (concrete cover), if confined by the steel liner. The steel liner should remain leak-tight.</li> <li>For extreme BDBTs, there should be no perforation, according to the applicable formula with a corresponding increase factor of 1.2 applied to the calculated thickness.</li> </ul> <p>Further detailed guidance on structural analysis of containment structures is given in Appendix A.</p> <p> Further information on the design and construction for containment and other safety-related structures can be found in the CSA N287 series of standards, and in CSA N291, <em>Requirements for Safety-Related Structures for CANDU Nuclear Power Plants</em>, respectively.</p> <h5>Additional information</h5> <p> Additional information may be found in:</p> <ul> <li>ACI, Standard 349, <em>Code Requirements for Nuclear Safety-Related Concrete Structures and Commentary</em>, Farmington Hills, Michigan, 2007.</li> <li>ASCE, Ed. 2, <em>Design of Blast-Resistant Buildings in Petrochemical Facilities</em>, Reston, Virginia, 2010.</li> <li>ASCE, 58, Manual and Reports on Engineering Practice, <em>Structural Analysis and Design of Nuclear Plant Facilities</em>, Reston, Virginia, 1980.</li> <li>Communications Security Establishment, TRA-1, <em>Harmonized Threat and Risk Assessment (TRA) Methodology</em>, Ottawa, Canada, 2007.</li> <li>CNSC, RD-321, <em>Criteria for Physical Protection Systems and Devices at High-Security Sites</em>, Ottawa, Canada, 2010.</li> <li>CNSC, RD-363, <em>Nuclear Security Officer Medical, Physical, and Psychological Fitness</em>, Ottawa, Canada, 2008.</li> <li>CNSC, G-274, <em>Security Programs for Category I or II Nuclear Material or Certain Nuclear Facilities</em>, Ottawa, Canada, 2003.</li> <li>CNSC, RD-346, <em>Site Evaluation for New Nuclear Power Plants</em>, Ottawa, Canada, 2008.</li> <li>CNSC, G-208, <em>Transportation Security Plans for Category I, II or III Nuclear Material</em>, Ottawa, Canada, 2003.</li> <li>CSA Group, N291, <em>Requirements for Safety-Related Structures for CANDU Nuclear Power Plants</em>, Ottawa, Canada.</li> <li>IAEA, TECDOC-967, Rev.1, <em>Guidance and considerations for the implementation of INFCIRC/225/Rev.5, The Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and Nuclear Facilities</em>, Vienna, 2002. </li> <li>IAEA, TECDOC-1276, <em>Handbook on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Materials and Facilities</em>, 2002.</li> <li>IAEA, INFCIRC-225, Rev.5, <em>Nuclear Security Recommendations on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and Nuclear Facilities</em>, Vienna, 2011.</li> <li>NEI, 07-13, <em>Methodology for Performing Aircraft Impact Assessments for New Plant Designs</em>, Washington, D.C., 2011.</li> <li>Unified Facilities Criteria, 3-340-02, <em>Structures to Resist the Effects of Accidental Explosions</em>, Washington, D.C., 2008.</li> <li>United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, <em>Guidelines for the Design and Assessment of Concrete Structures Subjected to Impact</em>, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom, 1990.</li> </ul> <h4 id="sec7-22-4">7.22.4 Cyber security</h4> <p>The design of computer-based I&amp;C systems important to safety shall provide a cyber security defensive architecture.</p> <p> Computer-based I&amp;C systems and components important to safety shall be protected from cyber attacks in order to maintain confidentiality, integrity and availability.</p> <p> A cyber security program shall be developed, implemented and maintained so as to achieve the security required in each phase of the computer-based I&amp;C systems' lifecycle.</p> <p> Cyber security features shall not adversely affect the functions or performance of SSCs important to safety.</p> <h5>Guidance</h5> <p> The security of computer-based I&amp;C systems is designed to provide a secure operational environment with defensive features, and to protect against cyber attacks.

The objective of the Canada-IAEA safeguards agreement is for the IAEA to provide annual assurance to Canada and to the international community that all declared nuclear material is employed in peaceful, non-explosive uses, and that there is no indication of undeclared nuclear material or activities.</p> <p> The CNSC is the governmental authority responsible for implementing the Canada-IAEA safeguards agreement.</p> <p> Safeguards considerations should be integrated during the early design phase of a new NPP. This approach is a well-established practice in the Canadian nuclear industry and can avoid the retrofitting of safeguards equipment after a design is completed, which could otherwise result in substantial cost increases in terms of redesign work, timeline extensions and additional demands on human resources.

The design shall consider all foreseeable reactor core configurations for normal operation.</p> <p>The reactor core, including the fuel elements, reactivity control mechanisms, reflectors, fuel channel and structural parts, shall be designed so that the reactor can be shutdown, cooled and held subcritical with an adequate margin in operational states, DBAs and DECs.</p> <p>The anticipated upper limit of possible deformation or other changes due to irradiation conditions shall be evaluated. These evaluations shall be supported by data from experiments, and from experience with irradiation. The design shall provide protection against those deformations, or any other changes to reactor structures that have the potential to adversely affect the behaviour of the core or associated systems.</p> <p>The reactor core and associated structures and cooling systems shall:</p> <ol> <li>withstand static and dynamic loading, including thermal expansion and contraction</li> <li>withstand vibration (such as flow-induced and acoustic vibration)</li> <li>ensure chemical compatibility, including service-related contaminants </li> <li>meet thermal material limits</li> <li>meet radiation damage limits</li> </ol> <p>The reactor core design shall include provisions for a guaranteed shutdown state as described in section 7.11.</p> <p>The design of the core shall be such that:</p> <ol> <li>the fission chain reaction is controlled during operational states</li> <li>the maximum degree of positive reactivity and its maximum rate of increase by insertion in operational states and DBAs are limited by a combination of the inherent neutronic characteristics of the core, its thermal-hydraulic characteristics, and the capabilities of the control system and means of shutdown, so that no resultant failure of the reactor pressure boundary will occur, cooling capability will be maintained, and no significant damage will occur to the reactor core</li> </ol> <p>The shutdown margin for all shutdown states shall be such that the core will remain subcritical for any credible changes in the core configuration and reactivity addition.</p> <p>If operator intervention is required to keep the reactor in a shutdown state, the feasibility, timeliness, and effectiveness of such intervention shall be demonstrated.</p> <h4>Guidance on nuclear design</h4> <p>The design of the reactor core should provide confidence that the permissible design limits, under operational states, DBAs and DECs, are not exceeded, taking into account engineering tolerances and uncertainties associated with the calculations.</p> <p>The nuclear design deals with flux and power distribution within the reactor core, the design and use of reactivity control systems for normal operation and for shutting down the reactor, core stability, the various reactivity feedback characteristics, and the physics of the fuel.</p> <p>The design of the reactor core and associated coolant and fuel systems should take into account all practical means so that, in the power operating range, the net effect of the prompt inherent nuclear feedback characteristics tends to compensate for a rapid increase in reactivity and power. The consequences of those accidents that would be aggravated by a positive reactivity feedback should be either acceptable, or be satisfactorily mitigated by other design features.</p> <p>The design should take into account measurements made in previous reactors and critical experiments and their use in the uncertainty analyses.

The processing of that information should include: <ul> <li>calculations (instrument-calculation correlations) involved in the processing </li> <li>operating procedures used</li> <li>the requirements for periodic check measurements</li> <li>the accuracy of design calculations used in developing correlations when primary variables are not directly measured </li> <li>the uncertainty analyses for the information and processing system</li> <li>the requirements for instruments, the calibration and calculations involved in their use, and the uncertainties involved in conversion of instrument readings into power distribution</li> <li>the limits and set points for control actions, alarms, or automatic trip for instrument systems and demonstration that these systems can maintain the reactor within design power distribution limits (including the instrumentation alarms for the limits of normal operation (e.g., offset limits, control bank limits) and for abnormal situations (e.g., flux tilt alarms)</li> <li>measurements in previous reactors and critical experiments, including their use in the uncertainty analyses</li> <li>measurements needed for start-up confirmatory tests and the required periodical measurements</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>The limiting power distributions should be determined such that the limits on power densities and peaking factors can be maintained in operation. These limiting power distributions may be maintained (i.e., not exceeded) administratively (i.e., not by automatic shutdown), provided a suitable demonstration is made that sufficient, properly translated information and alarms are available from the reactor instrumentation to keep the operator informed.</p> <p>The design should establish the correlation between design power distributions and operating power distributions, including instrument-calculation correlations, operating procedures used, and measurements that will be taken. Necessary limits on these operations should be established.</p> <p>The breakdown of design power distributions into the following components should be established:</p> <ul> <li>power generated in the fuel</li> <li>power generated directly in the coolant and moderator</li> <li>power generated directly in the core internals</li> </ul> <p>The reference design core power distributions (axial, radial, and local distributions and peaking factors) used in AOO and accident analyses should be established. In addition, power distributions within fuel pins should be established.</p> <p>The design limits for power densities (and thus for peaking factors) during normal operation should be such that acceptable fuel design limits are not exceeded during AOOs and that other limits are not exceeded during DBAs and DECs. The design limits, along with related uncertainties, operating limits, instrument requirements, and set-points, should be incorporated into OLCs.</p> <h4>Reactivity coefficients</h4> <p>The design should establish and characterize the bounding reference values for reactivity coefficients. These reference values should be conservative.</p> <p>The range of plant states to be covered should include the entire operating range - from cold shutdown through full power - and the extremes reached in AOOs, DBAs and DECs. It should include the full range of the fuelling cycle, and an appropriate range of reactivity device configurations.</p> <p>The design calculations of reactivity coefficients should cover the full applicable range of the variables and modelling approximations in AOO and accident analyses, including approximations related to modelling and nodalization of the reactor cooling system. Where applicable, the difference between intra- and inter-assembly moderator coefficients needs to be established.</p> <p>Conservatism should be considered based on:</p> <ul> <li>the use of a coefficient (i.e., the analyses in which it is important)</li> <li>whether state of the art tools have been used for calculation of the coefficient</li> <li>the uncertainty associated with such calculations, experimental checks of the coefficient in operating reactors</li> <li>any required checks of the coefficient in the start-up program following significant core reconfiguration</li> </ul> <p>The design calculation should cover and be supported by the following:</p> <ul> <li>calculated nominal values for the reactivity coefficients, such as the coolant and moderator coefficients (temperature, void, or density coefficients), the Doppler coefficient and power coefficients</li> <li>uncertainty analyses for nominal values, including the magnitude of the uncertainty and the justification of the magnitude (by examination of the accuracy of the methods used in calculations), and comparison, where possible, with reactor experiments. </li> <li>combination of nominal values and uncertainties to provide suitably conservative values for use in reactor steady-state analysis (primarily control requirements), stability analyses, and the AOO and accident analyses</li> </ul> <p>For comparisons to experiments, it is important to show that the experiments are applicable and relevant, and the experimental conditions overlap the operating and anticipated accident conditions.</p> <p>It is recognized that reactivity coefficients of the design are important in determining the reactor behavior and safety characteristics. This document does not have specific requirements on the sign or magnitude of the reactivity coefficients including the power coefficient of reactivity. Instead, this document requires a number of design provisions related to the nuclear design to ensure that the design is acceptable for reactor control, stability and plant safety. If a reactor design has a positive power coefficient of reactivity for any operating state, the design authority should demonstrate that operation with a positive power coefficient is acceptable, by showing:</p> <ul> <li>a bounding value of power coefficient of reactivity has been calculated for all permitted operating states and used in control, stability, and safety analyses</li> <li>measurements of the power coefficient of reactivity are conducted at start-up and periodically for certain operating limiting core conditions to demonstrate that measured values are bounded by calculated values with adequate margin</li> <li>the reactor control system is designed with adequate reliability and has the capability to automatically accommodate for a positive power coefficient of reactivity for a wide range of AOOs</li> </ul> <p>The design should ensure that the likelihood of exceeding specified criteria of the AOOs without shutdown is sufficiently small, by demonstrating either that the criteria are met, or that a diverse shutdown means is installed, which reduces significantly the probability of a failure to shutdown.</p> <h4>Criticality</h4> <p>The nuclear design should ensure that the criticality of the reactor during refuelling is controlled. If on-power refuelling is used to compensate for core reactivity depletion, the nuclear design should establish the values of core excess reactivity, maximum local powers, amount of fuel loaded per refuelling operation and frequency of refuelling load. The design should also ensure that the maximum core excess reactivity and predicted local power peaks will not exceed the control system capability and fuel thermal limits.</p> <h4>Core stability</h4> <p>Power oscillations that could result in conditions exceeding specified acceptable fuel design limits should be reliably and readily detected and suppressed.</p> <p>Assessment of reactor core stability should include:</p> <ul> <li>phenomena and reactor aspects that influence the stability of the nuclear reactor core</li> <li>calculations and considerations given to xenon-induced spatial oscillations</li> <li>potential stability issues, due to other phenomena or conditions</li> <li>verification of the analytical methods for comparison with measured data</li> </ul> <h4>Analytical methods</h4> <p>The analytical methods and database used for nuclear design and reactor physics analyses should be consistent with modern best practices. Also, the experiments used to validate the analytical methods should be adequate representations of fuel designs in the reactor and ranges of key parameters in the validation database should overlap those expected in design and safety analysis.</p> <p>The design should be such that the analytical methods used in the nuclear design (including those for predicting criticality, reactivity coefficients, burnup and stability) as well as the database and nuclear data libraries used for neutron cross-section data and other nuclear parameters (including delayed neutron and photo neutron data and other relevant data) are adequate and fit for application, based on adequate qualification. The qualification should be based on proven practices for validation and verification, using the acceptable codes and standards.</p> <p>A validation or verification method can be proven either by meeting accepted verification and validation standards, or by established practice, or some combination of these. New method(s) are &quot;proven&quot; by performing a number of acceptance and demonstration tests that show the method(s) meets pre-defined criteria.</p> <h4>Core internals and vessel</h4> <p>The nuclear design should establish:</p> <ul> <li>neutron flux spectrum above 1 million electron volts (MeV) in the core, at the core boundaries, and at the inside vessel wall, if applicable</li> <li>assumptions used in the calculations, these include the power level, the use factor, the type of fuel cycle considered, and the design life of the vessel</li> <li>computer codes used in the analysis</li> <li>the database for fast neutron cross-sections</li> <li>the geometric modelling of the reactor core, internals, and vessel(s)</li> <li>uncertainties in the calculations</li> </ul> <h4>Additional information</h4> <p>Additional information may be found in:</p> <ul> <li>CSA Group, N286.7.1, Guideline for the application of N286.7-99, <em>Quality assurance of analytical, scientific, and design computer programs for nuclear power plants</em>, Toronto, Canada.</li> <li><a href="https://subscribe.csa.ca/irj/servlet/prt/portal/prtroot/org.csagroup.drmsolution.DrmEncryptorComponent/N286.7_1999_2411587.pdf">CSA Group, N286.7</a>, <em>Quality Assurance of Analytical, Scientific, and Design Computer Programs for Nuclear Power Plants</em>, Toronto, Canada.</li> <li>CSA Group, N290.4, <em>Requirements</em> <em>for reactor control systems of nuclear power plants</em>, Toronto, Canada.</li> <li><a href="https://subscribe.csa.ca/irj/servlet/prt/portal/prtroot/org.csagroup.drmsolution.DrmEncryptorComponent/N290.1_1980_2412666.pdf">CSA Group, CAN3-N290.1</a>, <em>Requirements for the Shutdown Systems of CANDU Nuclear Power Plants</em>, Toronto, Canada.</li> <li>IAEA, NS-G-2.5, <em>Core Management and Fuel Handling for Nuclear Power Plants</em>, Vienna, 2002.</li> <li>IAEA, NS-G-1.12, <em>Design of the Reactor Core for Nuclear Power Plants</em>, Vienna, 2005.</li> <li>U.S. NRC, Regulatory Guide 1.77, <em>Assumptions Used for Evaluating a Control Rod Ejection Accident for Pressurized Water Reactors</em>, Washington, D.C., 1974.</li> <li>U.S. NRC, Regulatory Guide 1.203, <em>Transient and Accident Analysis Methods</em>, Washington, D.C., 2005.</li> </ul> <h4>Guidance on core management and fuel handling</h4> <p>The reactor design should be such that the plant will operate within the specified operating limits for the entire reactor lifecycle (including intermediate reactor core states).</p> <p>The design should provide for functional tests to be performed periodically for monitoring the health of the reactor components.</p> <p>The design should provide for the capability to monitor online important core parameters, to ensure that the acceptable operating limits for the reactor are not exceeded during normal operation. The types of detectors and other devices used in monitoring the core parameters should be described.</p> <p>The reactor control strategy should be defined, to ensure that the reactor will be restored to an acceptable safe state if any reactor parameter deviates from its allowed domain. The control strategy should be such that fuel integrity will be maintained for all AOOs.</p> <p>The refuelling scheme should be developed to ensure that the intermediate refuelling configurations do not have more reactivity than the most reactive configuration approved in the design. The core parameters for the intermediate configurations should be within their approved limits.</p> <p>The design should allow for data acquisition during reactor operation and record-keeping for later retrieval and analysis.</p> <p>The design should take into account the details of fuel management strategy including the loading of fuel into the fresh core, and the criteria for determining the location of fuel assemblies to be unloaded from the reactor and loaded with fresh fuel.</p> <p>For reactor designs where a significant fraction of the fuel is replaced or shuffled during fuelling, the design should provide for diagnostic tests at startup. These tests should verify that the core parameters are within their allowed range.</p> <h4>Guidance on mechanical design of reactor internals</h4> <p>The reactor internals classified as core support structures according to the ASME <em>Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code</em> (BPVC), Section III, Division 1, NG-1121, <em>Core Support Structures</em>, should be designed, fabricated, and examined in accordance with the provisions of ASME BPVC Section III Division 1, subsection NG.</p> <p>Those reactor internals not classified as ASME BPVC Code, Section III, Division 1, <em>Core Support</em> <em>Structures</em> should be classified as internal structures in accordance with ASME Code, Section III, Division 1, Subsection NG-1122. The design criteria, loading conditions, and analyses that provide the basis for the design of reactor internals (other than the core support structures) should meet the guidelines of ASME Code, Section III, Division 1, Subsection NG-3000, and be constructed so as to not adversely affect the integrity of the core support structures. If other guidelines (e.g., manufacturer standards or empirical methods based on field experience and testing) are the bases for the stress, deformation, and fatigue criteria, those guidelines should be identified and their use justified in the design.</p> <p>For non-ASME code structures, components and supports, design margins presented for allowable stress, deformation, and fatigue should be equal to or greater than margins for other plants of similar design with successful operating experience. Any decreases in design margins should be justified.</p> <p>Specific reactor internals of a high safety class should be designed, fabricated, and examined in accordance with the applicable codes and standards, such as ASME Section III for light water reactors (LWR), and CSA N285.0, <em>General Requirements for Pressure-retaining Systems and</em> <em>Components in CANDU Nuclear Power Plants</em> for CANDU.</p> <h4 id="sec8-1-1">8.1.1 Fuel elements, assemblies and design</h4> <p>Fuel assembly design shall include all components in the assembly, such as the fuel matrix, cladding, spacers, support plates, movable rods inside the assembly etc. The fuel assembly design shall also identify all interfacing systems.</p> <p>Fuel assemblies and the associated components shall be designed to withstand the anticipated irradiation and environmental conditions in the reactor core, and all processes of deterioration that can occur in operational states. The fuel shall remain suitable for continued use after AOOs. At the design stage, consideration shall be given to long-term storage of irradiated fuel assemblies after discharge from the reactor.</p> <p>Fuel design limits shall be established to include, as a minimum, limits on fuel power or temperature, limits on fuel burnup, and limits on the leakage of fission products in the reactor cooling system. The design limits shall reflect the importance of preserving the fuel matrix and cladding, as these are first and second barriers to fission product release, respectively.</p> <p>The design shall account for all known degradation mechanisms, with allowance being made for uncertainties in data, calculations, and fuel fabrication.</p> <p>Fuel assemblies shall be designed to permit adequate inspection of their structures and components prior to and following irradiation.</p> <p>In DBAs, the fuel assembly and its component parts shall remain in position with no distortion that would prevent effective post-accident core cooling or interfere with the actions of reactivity control devices or mechanisms. The design shall specify the acceptance criteria necessary to meet these requirements in DBAs. <br /> The requirements for reactor and fuel assembly design shall apply in the event of changes in fuel management strategy, or in operating conditions, over the lifetime of the plant.</p> <p>Fuel design and design limits shall reflect a verified and auditable knowledge base. The fuel shall be qualified for operation, either through experience with the same type of fuel in other reactors, or through a program of experimental testing and analysis, to ensure that fuel assembly requirements are met.</p> <h5>Guidance</h5> <p>The fuel design and qualification should provide assurance that the reactor core design requirements in section 8.1 are met.</p> <p>Acceptance criteria should be established for fuel damage, fuel rod failure, and fuel coolability. These criteria should be derived from experiments that identify the limitations of the material properties of the fuel and fuel assembly, and related analyses. The fuel design criteria and other design considerations are discussed below.</p> <h5>Fuel damage</h5> <p>Fuel damage criteria should be established for all known damage mechanisms in operational states (normal operation and AOOs). The damage criteria should assure that fuel dimensions remain within operational tolerances, and that functional capabilities are not reduced below those assumed in the safety analysis. When applicable, the fuel damage criteria should consider high burnup effects based on irradiated material properties data. The criteria should include stress, strain or loading limits, the cumulative number of strain fatigue cycles, fretting wear, oxidation, hydriding (deuteriding in CANDU reactors), build-up of corrosion products, dimensional changes, rod internal gas pressures, worst-case hydraulic loads, and LWR control rod insertability.</p> <h5>Fuel rod failure</h5> <p>Fuel rod failure applies to operational states, DBAs and DECs. Fuel rod failure criteria should be provided for all known fuel rod failure mechanisms. The design should ensure that fuel does not fail as a result of specific causes during operational states. Fuel rod failures could occur during DBAs and DECs, and are accounted for in the safety analysis.</p> <p>Assessment methods should be stated for, fuel failure mechanisms, reactor loading and power maneuvering limitations, and fuel duty which lead to an acceptably low probability of failure. When applicable, the fuel rod failure criteria should consider high burnup effects, based on data of irradiated material properties. The criteria should include:</p> <ul> <li>hydriding</li> <li>cladding collapse</li> <li>cladding overheating </li> <li>fuel pellet overheating </li> <li>excessive fuel enthalpy</li> <li>pellet-clad interaction</li> <li>stress-corrosion cracking </li> <li>cladding bursting </li> <li>mechanical fracturing</li> </ul> <h5>Fuel coolability</h5> <p>Fuel coolability applies to DBAs and, to the extent practicable, DECs. Fuel coolability criteria should be provided for all damage mechanisms in DBAs and DECs. The fuel should be designed to ensure that fuel rod damage will not interfere with effective emergency core cooling. The cladding temperatures should not reach a temperature high enough to allow a significant metal-water reaction to occur, thereby minimizing the potential for fission product release. The criteria should include cladding embrittlement, fuel rod ballooning, structural deformation and, in CANDU, beryllium braze penetration.</p> <h5>Other considerations</h5> <p>The design should also include: </p> <ul> <li>all expected fuel handling activities</li> <li>the effects of post-irradiation fuel assembly handling</li> <li>cooling flow of other components of LWR fuel assembly (such as control rods, poison rods, instrumentation, or neutron sources)</li> </ul> <h5>Testing, inspection, and surveillance programs</h5> <p>Programs for testing and inspection of new fuel, as well as for online fuel monitoring and post-irradiation surveillance of irradiated fuel should be established.</p> <h5>Fuel specification</h5> <p>The design should establish the specification of fuel rods and assembly (including LWR control rods) in order to minimize design deviations and to determine whether all design bases are met (such as limits and tolerances).</p> <h5>Reactor core thermal hydraulic design</h5> <p>The thermalhydraulic design should be such that sufficient margin exists with regard to maintaining adequate heat transfer from the fuel to the reactor coolant system, to prevent fuel sheath overheating. The design requirements can be demonstrated by meeting a set of derived acceptance criteria, as required by REGDOC-2.4.1, <em>Deterministic Safety Analysis</em>.</p> <p>Critical heat flux (CHF) is defined as the heat flux at departure from nucleate boiling (DNB), commonly used in pressurized water reactors (PWRs), or at dryout, commonly used in CANDU designs.</p> <p>It should be noted that, although a thermal margin criterion is sufficient to demonstrate that overheating from a deficient cooling mechanism can be avoided; other mechanistic methods may be acceptable as CHF is not considered as a failure mechanism. In some designs, CHF conditions during transients can be tolerated if it can be shown by other methods that the sheath temperatures do not exceed well-defined acceptable limits.</p> <p>However, any other criteria than the CHF criterion should address sheath temperature, pressure, time duration, oxidation, embrittlement etc., and these new criteria should be supported by sufficient experimental and analytical evidence. In the absence of such evidence, the core thermal-hydraulic design is expected to demonstrate a thermal margin to CHF.</p> <p>The demonstration of thermal margin is expected to be presented in a manner that accounts for all possible reactor operational states and conditions, as determined from operating maps including all AOOs. The demonstration should also include long term effects of plant aging and other expected changes to core configuration over the operating life of the plant.</p> <p>The demonstration of thermal margin should thoroughly address uncertainties of various parameters affecting the thermal margin. The design should identify all sources of significant uncertainties that contribute to the uncertainty of thermal margin. The uncertainty for each of the sources should be quantified with supportable evidence.</p> <p>In addition to the demonstration of thermal margin, the core thermal-hydraulic design should also address possible core power and flow oscillations and thermal-hydraulic instabilities. The design should be such that power and flow oscillations that result in conditions exceeding specified acceptable fuel design limits are not possible or can be reliably and readily detected and suppressed.</p> <h5>Additional information</h5> <p>Additional information may be found in:</p> <ul> <li>ANSI/ANS, 57.5, <em>Light Water Reactor Fuel Assembly Mechanical Design and Evaluation</em>, La Grange Park, Illinois, 1996.</li> <li>CNSC, G-144, <em>Trip Parameter Acceptance Criteria for the Safety Analysis of CANDU Nuclear Power Plants</em>, Ottawa, Canada, 2006.</li> <li>U.S. NRC, NUREG-0800, <em>Standard Review Plan for the Review of Safety Analysis Reports for Nuclear Power Plants: LWR Edition - Fuel System Design</em>, Section 4.2, Washington, D.C., 2007.</li> </ul> <h4 id="sec8-1-2">8.1.2 Control systems</h4> <p>The design shall provide the means for detecting levels and distributions of neutron flux.

For this means of shutdown, a transient recriticality may be permitted in exceptional circumstances if the specified fuel and component limits are not exceeded.</p> <p>At least one means of shutdown shall be independently capable of rendering the reactor subcritical from normal operation, in AOOs and DBAs, and maintaining the reactor subcritical by an adequate margin and with high reliability, for even the most reactive conditions of the core.</p> <p>Means shall be provided to ensure that there is a capability to shut down the reactor in DECs, and to maintain the reactor subcritical even for the most limiting conditions of the reactor core, including severe degradation of the reactor core.</p> <p>Redundancy shall be provided in the fast-acting means of shutdown if, in the event that the credited means of reactivity control fails during any AOO or DBA, inherent core characteristics are unable to maintain the reactor within specified limits.</p> <p>While resetting the means of shutdown, the maximum amount of positive reactivity and the maximum rate of reactivity increase shall be within the capacity of the reactor control system.</p> <p>To improve reliability, stored energy shall be used in shutdown actuation.</p> <p>The effectiveness of the means of shutdown (i.e., speed of action and shutdown margin) shall be such that specified limits are not exceeded, and the possibility of recriticality or reactivity excursion following a PIE is minimized.</p> <h4>Guidance</h4> <p>For the two means of shutting down the reactor to be independent of each other, they do not share components. If both means act inside the core and complete separation is not possible, adequate separation of ex-core components should be demonstrated.</p> <p>The design uses diverse methods for all aspects of the shutdown means such as:</p> <ul> <li>the insertion of solid control rods and injection of a solution of neutron absorbing material are the diverse methods normally used in water-cooled reactors</li> <li>diverse methods should be considered in the design of sensors, logic and actuation of the shutdown means</li> </ul> <p>As stated in this regulatory document, &quot;redundancy shall be provided in the fast-acting means of shutdown<em>&quot;</em> unless the safety analysis demonstrates that, for any AOO or DBA coincident with failure of a single fast-acting means of shutdown, the acceptance criteria can be met. In which case, only one fast-acting means of shutdown would be required.</p> <p>For shutdown means based on injection of a neutron absorbing solution, chemistry-related issues (such as avoiding precipitation) should be addressed.</p> <p>The design authority should specify the requirements for inspection, test and maintenance, including commissioning tests to verify the speed and depth of shutdown for each shutdown means.</p> <p>For LWR designs, fuel rod bowing can lead to loads on control rod guide tubes which may impair a rod-based shutdown means. The fuel design should ensure that this does not occur in operational states and DBAs.</p> <p>The most reactive conditions of the core required for the analysisnormally include a core with maximum allowable excess reactivity (for example, following batch refuelling) and the most reactive conditions for coolant and moderator temperature and density (for example, at cold shutdown conditions for a reactor with a negative temperature coefficient of reactivity).</p> <p>For CANDU reactors, there is a possibility of an in-core loss of coolant accident (LOCA). This poses a special challenge to reactivity control systems. In particular, hydraulic loads from an in-core LOCA can damage shutoff rod guides, and possibly damage poison injection nozzles. If shutdown action is required for an in-core LOCA, the design specification should identify how many reactivity devices may be damaged by the in-core LOCA. This should be consistent with the assumptions in the safety analysis. The results of the analysis of the extent of the damage and supporting experiments should be provided.</p> <p>The performance criteria for the speed and depth of a fast acting shutdown means should be provided by the design authority. A shutdown means is considered to be effective if the safety analysis acceptance criteria are met. The performance criteria for an adequate subcriticality margin of a shutdown means should be provided by the design authority.</p> <p>For LWRs, in particular pressurized water reactors (PWRs), a large LOCA can lead to significant hydraulic loads on core internals, such as control rod guides in the upper plenum. Core barrel distortion could lead to misalignments. If control rod insertion is credited in the safety analysis for a large LOCA (most PWRs do not credit rod movement), the design should demonstrate that control rod insertion will not be impeded.</p> <h4 id="sec8-4-1">8.4.1 Reactor trip parameters</h4> <p>The design authority shall specify derived acceptance criteria for reactor trip parameter effectiveness for all AOOs and DBAs, and shall perform a safety analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of the means of shutdown.</p> <p>For each credited means of shutdown, the design shall specify a direct trip parameter to initiate reactor shutdown for all AOOs and DBAs in time to meet the respective derived acceptance criteria. Where a direct trip parameter does not exist for a given credited means, there shall be two diverse trip parameters specified for that means.</p> <p>For all AOOs and DBAs, there shall be at least two diverse trip parameters unless it can be shown that failure to trip will not lead to unacceptable consequences.</p> <p>There shall be no gap in trip coverage within the OLCs for any operating condition (such as power, temperature), taking into account plant aging. This shall be ensured by the provision of additional trip parameters if necessary. A different level of effectiveness may be acceptable for the additional trip parameters.</p> <p>The extent of trip coverage provided by all available parameters shall be documented for the entire spectrum of failures for each set of PIEs.</p> <p>An assessment of the accuracy and the potential failure modes of the trip parameters shall be provided in the design documentation.</p> <h5>Guidance</h5> <p>The effectiveness of trip parameters should be assessed through safety analysis performed in accordance with REGDOC-2.4.1, <em>Deterministic Safety Analysis</em>.</p> <p>Trip coverage should be demonstrated across the full range of operating states, for all credited shutdown means and all credited trip parameters. Note that the number of credited shutdown means and the number of credited trip parameters can vary with the event, the reactor design, and whether there is a direct trip available.</p> <p>Defining derived acceptance criteria appropriate to a particular design is the responsibility of the design authority. CNSC REGDOC-2.4.1, <em>Deterministic Safety Analysis,</em> provides the requirements.</p> <p>Derived acceptance criteria should be defined separately for AOOs and DBAs. The derived acceptance criteria should be set to give an appropriate level of confidence that a fundamental safety function is assured, or that a barrier to fission product release will not fail. The derived acceptance criteria should:</p> <ul> <li>be quantifiable and well understood</li> <li>account for the fact that the safety analysis is stylized, and the plant condition at the time of the accident may be significantly different from the analyzed state</li> <li>cover uncertainties in analysis, input plant and analysis parameters, as well as code validation</li> </ul> <p>Direct trips are the preferred means of actuating a shutdown means, due to their robustness and low dependence on calculational models.</p> <p>Diverse trip parameters measure different physical variables on the reactor, thus providing additional protection against common mode failure. Where it is impracticable to provide full diversity of trip parameters, different measurement locations, different instrument types and different processing computers should be provided. Manual trip is considered an acceptable trip parameter, if the operator has adequate time to initiate the shutdown action following unambiguous indication of the need to perform the action (in accordance with section 8.10.4).</p> <p>It is the responsibility of the design authority to identify and justify those trip parameters that can be considered &quot;direct&quot;. The design authority should also demonstrate that any trip parameters that are a measure of the event, but not a measure of the challenge to acceptance criteria, cannot be &quot;masked&quot; or &quot;blinded&quot; by control system action or other means.</p> <p>Trips that are dependent on a number of measured variables, such as low DNBR (departure from nucleate boiling ratio) trips in PWRs can only be considered direct if all the variables are direct.</p> <p>Guidance on applying the requirements for number and diversity of trip parameters is given in REGDOC-2.4.1, <em>Deterministic Safety Analysis</em>.</p> <p>REGDOC-2.4.1 also provides the minimum expectations for the number of trip parameters.</p> <p>A manual reactor trip can be considered to be equivalent to a trip parameter, if the requirements for crediting operator action from the main control room are met (see section 8.10.4) and the reliability of manual shutdown meets the reliability requirements for an automatic trip.</p> <h4 id="sec8-4-2">8.4.2 Reliability</h4> <p>The design shall permit ongoing demonstration that each means of shutdown is being operated and maintained in a manner that ensures continued adherence to reliability and effectiveness requirements.</p> <p>Periodic testing of the systems and their components shall be scheduled at a frequency commensurate with applicable requirements.</p> <h5>Guidance</h5> <p>The reliability calculation should include sensing the need for shutdown, initiation of shutdown, and insertion of negative reactivity. All elements necessary to complete the shutdown function should be included.</p> <p>The reliability of the shutdown function should be such that the cumulative frequency of failure to shutdown on demand is less than 10<sup>-5</sup> failures per demand, and the contribution of all&nbsp;sequences involving failure to shutdown&nbsp;to the large release frequency of the safety goals&nbsp;is less than 10<sup>-7</sup>/yr. This considers the likelihood of the initiating event and recognizes that the two shutdown means may not be completely independent.</p> <p>Section 7.6.2 requires that the shutdown function be delivered even in the presence of any single failure and even during the worst configuration from testing and maintenance. For example, for a rod based system to meet the SFC, the safety analysis may assume that the two highest worth control rods are unavailable (one for testing, and one assumed to fail on demand, in accordance with the SFC). In this case, no further testing of rods would be allowed until the rod under testing becomes available. </p> <h4 id="sec8-4-3">8.4.3 Monitoring and operator action</h4> <p>Once automatic shutdown is initiated, it shall be impossible for an operator to prevent its actuation.</p> <p>The need for manual shutdown actuation shall be minimized.</p> <p>The means for manual actuation and for monitoring shutdown status shall be provided in the main control room and secondary control room.</p> <h3 id="sec8-5">8.5 Emergency core cooling system</h3> <p>All water-cooled nuclear power reactors shall be equipped with an emergency core cooling system (ECCS). The function of this safety system is to transfer heat from the reactor core following a loss of reactor coolant that exceeds makeup capability. All equipment required for correct operation of the ECCS shall be considered part of the system or its safety support system(s).</p> <p>Systems that supply electrical power or cooling water to equipment used in the operation of the ECCS shall be classified as safety support systems, and shall be subject to all relevant requirements and expectations.</p> <p>The design shall take into account the effect on core reactivity of the mixing of ECCS water with reactor coolant water, including possible mixing due to in-leakage.</p> <p>The ECCS shall meet the following criteria for all DBAs involving loss of coolant:</p> <ol> <li>All fuel assemblies and components in the reactor shall be kept in a configuration such that continued removal of the residual heat produced by the fuel can be maintained.</li> <li>A continued cooling flow (recovery flow) shall be supplied to prevent further damage to the fuel after adequate cooling of the fuel is re-established by the ECCS.</li> </ol> <p>The ECCS recovery flow path shall be such that impediment to the recovery of coolant following a loss of coolant accident by debris or other material is avoided.</p> <p>The design shall ensure that maintenance and reliability testing can be carried out without a reduction in the effectiveness of the system below the OLCs, if the testing is conducted when ECCS availability is required.</p> <p>In the event of an accident when injection of emergency coolant is required, it shall not be readily possible for an operator to prevent the injection from taking place.</p> <p>All ECCS components that may contain radioactive material shall be located inside containment or in an extension of containment.</p> <p>ECCS piping in an extension of containment that may contain radioactivity from the reactor core shall be subject to the following requirements:</p> <ol> <li>As a piping extension to containment, it meets the requirements for metal penetrations of containment.</li> <li>All piping and components of the ECCS recovery flow path piping that are open to the containment atmosphere are designed for a pressure greater than the containment design pressure.</li> <li>All ECCS recovery flow paths are housed in a confinement structure which prevents leakage of radioactivity to the environment and to adjacent structures.</li> <li>This housing includes detection capability for leakage of radioactivity, and the capability to either return the radioactivity to the flow path, or to collect the radioactivity and store (or process it) in a system designed for this purpose.</li> </ol> <p>Intermediate or secondary cooling piping loops shall have leak detection, whether the ECCS recovery system is inside or outside of containment, with the leak detection being such that upon detection of radioactivity from the ECCS recovery flow, the loops can be isolated as per the requirements for containment isolation.</p> <p> Inadvertent operation of all or part of the ECCS shall have no detrimental effect on plant safety.</p> <h4>Guidance</h4> <p> The design authority should describe any reactivity control function performed by the ECCS, together with necessary limits and conditions. For example, PWRs often credit soluble boron in the ECCS accumulators and storage tanks, to supplement control rod insertion for long term reactivity control.</p> <p> ECCS designs should be proven by appropriate experimental programs and computer modelling. It should be demonstrated that there is adequate experimental evidence of ECCS effectiveness.</p> <p> Examples of items that could be important in the ECCS design include:</p> <ul> <li>mechanisms for core bypassing (e.g., downcomer bypass during blowdown in PWRs, or core bypass via steam generators in CANDU)</li> <li>effects of non-condensable gas on ECCS performance</li> <li>phenomena that can impede core refill and rewet (such as periods of stagnation, steam binding in PWR steam generators, parallel channel effects in CANDU)</li> <li>effect of multi-dimensional flow in heat transport system headers in CANDU</li> <li>effect of non-uniform channel flow resistance in the CANDU core (e.g., peripheral low-flow and low-power channels having much higher flow resistance for ECCS refill)</li> <li>effect of the pressurizer</li> </ul> <p>Section 8.5 requires that the ECCS is capable of removing residual heat over an extended period. This normally involves recovering water spilled from the break, cooling it and returning it to the reactor. It should be demonstrated that:</p> <ul> <li>the design is capable of recirculating coolant even in the presence of the maximum quantity of debris that may be present after a LOCA</li> <li>possible chemical effects in the reactor building recovery sump have been considered, and any chemical precipitates and other species (such as gels, colloids etc.) cannot significantly impair ECCS recovery flow (for example, at strainers or the heat exchangers)</li> <li>recovery actions (such as transfer to hot leg injection of ECCS, or transfer to the normal residual heat removal system) are described and shown to be achievable; long-term removal of heat by boiling in the core could potentially lead to deposition or fouling (for example, precipitation of boric acid crystals) impairing flow and heat transfer</li> <li>wear on bearings and seals has been considered, including abrasion by small particles and chemical corrosion</li> <li>natural circulation flows, where credited, are capable of providing sufficient flows and cannot be impaired by such effects as accumulation of non-condensable gas or adverse temperature distributions</li> </ul> <p>Sections 7.14 and 7.16 describe the inspection, test and maintenance requirements which should include:</p> <ul> <li>commissioning tests to verify flow, pressure drop and (if applicable) tank isolation after injection for accumulators and other makeup tanks</li> <li>commissioning tests to verify pump head, flow and system pressure drop for pumped injection</li> </ul> <p>As stated in this regulatory document, &quot;in the event of an accident when injection of emergency coolant is required, it shall not be readily possible for an operator to prevent the injection from taking place<em>.</em>&quot; This can be achieved by a variety of methods to ensure that the blocking action is intentional (such as requiring multiple actions, sequential actions, actions that are spatially separated, or actions that have to be performed by different people).</p> <p> Emergency operating procedures should prohibit blocking of ECCS injection, unless there is clearfix and unambiguous indication that it is not needed (for example, if there is clearfix indication that there is adequate inventory to ensure core cooling, and that the inventory is not decreasing).</p> <p> Injection of a large volume of cold water may cause pressurized thermal shock to the reactor coolant pressure boundary, or distortion of reactor internals. The design authority should demonstrate that thermal shock has been adequately addressed in the design, in terms of calculating transient fluid conditions at key locations, as well as resulting metal temperature and the corresponding stresses.</p> <p> Water hammer loads may be generated by operation of valves, or by condensation when cold water is injected into steam filled systems. The design authority should demonstrate that a water hammer assessment has been performed.</p> <p class="text-right"><a href="#wb-main"><span class="wb-icon-nav-090-alt"></span>Top of page</a></p> <h3 id="sec8-6">8.6 Containment</h3> <h4 id="sec8-6-1">8.6.1 General</h4> <p>Each nuclear power reactor shall be installed within a containment structure, so as to minimize the release of radioactive materials to the environment during operational states and DBAs.

The openings between compartments shall be large enough to prevent significant pressure differentials which may cause damage to load-bearing and safety systems during AOOs, DBAs and DECs.</p> <p> The design of internal structures shall consider the hydrogen control strategy, and assist in the effectiveness of that strategy.</p> <h5>Guidance</h5> <p> Acceptable methods should be used to calculate pressure differentials and demonstrate that there will be no loss of safety function to load-bearing structures and safety systems during AOOs, DBAs and DECs (including consideration of hydrogen). In particular, the analyses of a large LOCA, main steamline break and DBE are expected to lead to challenging conditions. Analysis assumptions should ensure that they are conservative with respect to containment pressure, compartment differential pressure and hydrogen distribution, as well as the safety functions of SSCs.</p> <p>Sufficient openings should be provided between compartments, so as to preclude potential hydrogen accumulation at dead ends. If appropriate, phenomena such as flame acceleration and standing flames should be taken into account.</p> <p>The internal structures should provide adequate return flow paths for coolant (e.g., from a postulated pipe break to the containment sump) if credited in the safety analysis.

For example, if credited, fan motors should be designed for operation in post-accident combustible gas conditions.</p> <p>For DECs, all heat sources should be considered, including combustion of gases, metal-water reactions and the formation of solid solutions (including eutectics). The design should ensure that the heat removal capacity is consistent with analysis of containment conditions.</p> <p>Air systems (such as instrument air and breathing air) should be reliably isolated after a postulated initiating event that requires containment isolation, in order to prevent containment over-pressurization and to reduce combustion and explosion effects.</p> <h4 id="sec8-6-10">8.6.10 Control and cleanup of the containment atmosphere</h4> <p>The design shall provide systems to control the release of fission products, hydrogen, oxygen, and other substances into the reactor containment, as necessary, to:</p> <ol> <li>reduce the amount of fission products that might be released to the environment during an accident</li> <li>prevent deflagration or detonation that could jeopardize the integrity or leak tightness of the containment</li> </ol> <p>The design shall also:</p> <ol> <li>provide isolation of all sources of compressed air and other non-condensable gases into the containment atmosphere following an accident</li> <li>ensure that, in the case of ingress of non-condensable gas resulting from a PIE, containment pressure will not exceed the design limit</li> <li>provide isolation of compressed air sources to prevent any bypass of containment</li> </ol> <h4 id="sec8-6-11">8.6.11 Coverings, coatings and materials</h4> <p>The coverings and coatings for components and structures within the containment shall be carefully selected, and their methods of application shall be specified to ensure fulfillment of their safety functions. The primary objective of this requirement is to minimize interference with other safety functions or accident mitigation systems in the event of deterioration of coverings and coatings. In addition, the choice of materials inside containment shall take into account the impact on post-accident containment conditions, including fission product behaviour, acidity, equipment fouling, radiolysis, fires, and other factors that may affect containment performance and integrity, and fission product release.</p> <p> Coverings and coatings shall also be selected considering the need for their removal and replacement to permit access to components for maintenance and inspection.</p> <h5>Guidance</h5> <p> The design authority should demonstrate that there is confidence that interference with safety functions and other safety systems by coverings, coatings, and materials is minimized.

The claimed functionality and analysis should be supported by adequate evidence.</p> <p>The containment leakage rate in DECs with core damage should not exceed the design leakage rate for a sufficient period to allow for the implementation of offsite emergency measures. This period should be demonstrated, with reasonable confidence, to be at least 24 hours.</p> <p>The design should minimize generation of combustible, non-condensable gases from corium-concrete interaction.</p> <p>Containment venting design should take into account such factors as:</p> <ul> <li>ignition of flammable gases</li> <li>generation of non-condensable gases</li> <li>impact on filters by containment environmental conditions, such as radioactive materials, high temperature and high humidity</li> </ul> <p>Experimental or analytical evidence should be provided to demonstrate that venting will not lead to unfiltered and uncontrolled releases of radioactive materials into the environment.</p> <h3 id="sec8-7">8.7 Heat transfer to an ultimate heat sink</h3> <p>The design shall include systems for transferring residual heat from SSCs important to safety to an ultimate heat sink. This overall function shall be subject to very high levels of reliability during operational states, DBAs and DECs. All systems that contribute to the transport of heat by conveying heat, providing power, or supplying fluids to the heat transport systems, shall be therefore designed in accordance with the importance of their contribution to the function of heat transfer as a whole.</p> <p>Natural phenomena and human induced events shall be taken into account in the design of heat transfer systems, and in the choice of diversity and redundancy, both in the ultimate heat sinks and in the storage systems from which fluids for heat transfer are supplied.</p> <p>The design shall extend the capability to transfer residual heat from the core to an ultimate heat sink so that, in the event of a severe accident considered as a DEC:</p> <ol> <li>acceptable conditions can be maintained in SSCs needed for mitigation of severe accidents</li> <li>radioactive materials can be confined</li> <li>releases to the environment can be limited</li> </ol> <h4>Guidance</h4> <p> The safety significance and reliability requirements of the heat transfer to an ultimate heat sink should be addressed with respect to any claims made in the safety case for their availability to provide cooling for operational states, DBAs and DECs. </p> <h3 id="sec8-8">8.8 Emergency heat removal system</h3> <p>The design shall include an emergency heat removal system (EHRS) which provides for removal of residual heat in order to meet fuel design limits and reactor coolant boundary condition limits.</p> <p> If the design of the plant is such that the EHRS is required to mitigate the consequences of a DBA, then the EHRS shall be designed as a safety system.There shall be reasonable confidence that the EHRS will function during DECs, if required.</p> <p> Correct operation of the EHRS equipment following an accident shall not be dependent on power supplies from the electrical grid or from the turbine generators associated with any reactor unit that is located on the same site as the reactor involved in the accident.</p> <p> Where water is required for the EHRS, it shall come from a source that is independent of normal supplies.<br /> The design shall support maintenance and reliability testing without a reduction in system effectiveness below what is required by the OLCs.</p> <p> As far as practicable, inadvertent operation of the EHRS, or of part of the EHRS, shall not have a detrimental effect on plant safety.</p> <p> If the fire water supply or system components are interconnected to the EHRS, operation of one shall not impair operation of the other.</p> <h4>Guidance</h4> <p> The emergency heat removal system is to provide a path to ultimate heat sink, in the case that normal heat removal capabilities are not available. The purpose of this system is to prevent events from escalating and to mitigate their consequences.</p> <p> Emergency heat removal relates to post-accident heat removal and may be provided by a number of systems, depending on circumstances: </p> <ul> <li>post-LOCA heat removal may be provided by ECCS (refer to section 8.5)</li> <li>for non-LOCA events, emergency heat removal may be through primary or secondary cooling systems</li> </ul> <p>For all means of emergency heat removal, the design should be such that all equipment is appropriately designed to function in the class of accidents for which it is credited.</p> <p>If the system credited has another role in normal operation, then the design should be such that the system will meet the requirements of a safety system when used in DBAs or DECs. The design basis requirements for the system in this role should be provided.</p> <p>Many of the actions associated with operation of the systems credited for emergency heat removal may not be initiated automatically. When there is reliance on manual operation, the review of human factors considerations should have very high importance.</p> <p>Primary side emergency heat removal could be through normal shutdown cooling means. The design should be such that:</p> <ul> <li>a means of depressurizing the primary system is provided and the means of depressurization meets the requirements of a safety system, or </li> <li>the shutdown cooling system is capable of being operated at full primary pressure and temperature</li> </ul> <p>Passive or non-passive (e.g., natural circulation or pumped) heat removal may be used. Non-passive systems require emergency power. Natural circulation systems should demonstrate the capability over the full range of applicable operating conditions.</p> <p>Secondary side emergency heat removal that relies on water being provided to the secondary side of steam generators may be provided by a separate pumped supply or by a secondary depressurization and gravity feed. The water supply should meet the requirements of a safety system.</p> <h3 id="sec8-9">8.9 Electrical power systems</h3> <p>The design shall specify the required functions and performance characteristics of each electrical power system that provides normal, standby, emergency and alternate power supplies to ensure:</p> <ol> <li>sufficient capacity to support the safety functions of the connected loads in operational states, DBAs and DECs </li> <li>availability and reliability is commensurate with the safety significance of the connected loads</li> </ol> <p>The requirements of both the standby and emergency power systems may be met by a single system.</p> <p> Electrical power systems shall be designed to include the various modes of interaction between offsite power and onsite power.

The safety analysis should provide information concerning offsite power circuits coming from the transmission system to the plant switchyard. A switchyard common to both circuits is acceptable, but separate transmission line towers should be used. For some reactor designs, it might be sufficient to have only one offsite power connection, although this should be justified.</p> <p> Each of the plant's offsite transmission lines should have the capacity and capability to supply power to all plant electrical loads under all plant states.</p> <p> A minimum of one offsite transmission line and associated PPS should be designed to be automatically available to provide power to its associated safety divisions within a few seconds following an AOO or a DBA.</p> <p> A second PPS circuit should be designed to be available within a period of time commensurate with the requirement to support plant safety functions during AOOs and DBAs.</p> <p> For plants designed for house load operation, the normal AC power system should be designed to accommodate generator voltage and frequency transients associated with transferring from normal operation to the house load operating mode.</p> <h4>Additional information</h4> <p> Additional information may be found in:</p> <ul> <li>CSA Group, N290.5, <em>Requirements for electrical power and instrument air systems of CANDU nuclear power plants,</em> Toronto, Canada (note<strong>: </strong>CSA N290.5 is a CANDU specific document which particularly addresses the two group design philosophy).</li> <li>IAEA, NS-G-1.8, <em>Design of Emergency Power Systems of Nuclear Power Plants</em>, Vienna, 2004.</li> <li>IEEE, 1050, <em>Guide for Instrumentation and Control Equipment Grounding in Generating Stations</em>, Piscataway, New Jersey 1996.</li> <li>IEEE, C62.23, <em>IEEE Application Guide for Surge Protection of Electric Generating Plants</em>, Piscataway, New Jersey, 1995.</li> <li>IEEE, 141, <em>IEEE Recommended Practice for Electric Power Distribution for Industrial Plants</em>, Piscataway, New Jersey, 1993.</li> <li>IEEE, 242, <em>IEEE Recommended Practice for Protection and Coordination of Industrial and Commercial Power Systems</em>, Piscataway, New Jersey, 2001.</li> <li>IEEE, 308,&nbsp;<em>IEEE</em> <em>Standard Criteria for Class 1E Power Systems for Nuclear Power Generating Stations</em>, Piscataway, New Jersey, 2001.</li> <li>IEEE, 387, <em>IEEE Standard Criteria for Diesel-Generator Units Applied as Standby Power Supplies for Nuclear Power Generating Stations</em>, Piscataway, New Jersey, 1995.</li> <li>IEEE, 279, <em>IEEE Standard: Criteria for Protection Systems for Nuclear Power Generating Stations</em>, Piscataway, New Jersey, 1971.</li> <li>IEEE, 665, <em>IEEE Standard for Generating Station Grounding</em>, Piscataway, New Jersey,Â  reaffirmed 2001.</li> </ul> <h4 id="sec8-9-1">8.9.1 Standby and emergency power systems</h4> <p>The standby and emergency power systems shall have sufficient capacity and reliability, for a specified mission time, and in the presence of a single failure to provide the necessary power to: </p> <ol> <li>maintain the plant in a safe shutdown state and ensure nuclear safety in DBAs and DECs</li> <li>support severe accident management actions</li> </ol> <p>Dedicated onsite fuel storage facilities shall have a sufficient quantity of fuel to operate standby and emergency power sources while supplying connected loads.</p> <p> The PPS to the electrical power systems shall be from offsite power or the main generator.<br /> The design shall:</p> <ol> <li>identify all events for which actuation of standby and emergency power sources are required</li> <li>specify the required start-up time and safety load energization times for standby and emergency power sources such that they are available in a time commensurate with the safety function of the connected loads</li> <li>specify conditions for electrical protection to trip standby and emergency power sources to protect equipment from significant failure</li> <li>minimize challenges to standby and emergency power supplies as a result of an electrical system disturbance or transient condition</li> <li>specify requirements for standby and emergency power supplies including all support auxiliaries and fuel supplies </li> </ol> <p>The design of the emergency power system shall take into account common-cause failures involving loss of normal power supply, and standby power supply (if applicable).

A hazard analysis shall demonstrate the ability of the design to effectively respond to credible common-cause events.</p> <p> As discussed in section 9.1, the first step of the hazard analysis is to identify PIEs.

To ensure the availability of required safety functions and operator actions, all the SSCs important to safety (including the main control room, secondary control room and emergency support facilities) should be adequately protected against relevant internal and external hazards.</p> <p> The hazard analysis should establish a list of relevant internal and external hazards that may affect plant safety. For the relevant hazards, the review should demonstrate, by using deterministic and probabilistic techniques, that the probability or consequences of the hazard are sufficiently low so that no specific protective measures are necessary, or that the preventive and mitigating measures against the hazard are adequate.</p> <p> All internal and external hazards are considered as part of PIEs. The hazards that make an insignificant contribution to plant risk can be screened out from the detailed analysis; however, the rationale for this screening should be provided.

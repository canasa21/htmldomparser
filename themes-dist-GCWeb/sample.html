      <h2 id="sec1">1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>A deep geological repository (DGR) is an engineered facility where radioactive waste is emplaced in a deep, stable geological formation (usually several hundred metres or more below the surface) designed to isolate and contain radioactive waste to provide the long-term isolation of nuclear substances from the biosphere <sup><a id="fnb1a-ref" class="fn-lnk ui-link" href="#fnb1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup>. After closure there is no intention to retrieve or transfer the radioactive waste<sup><a href="#fnb2" id="fnb2a-ref" class="fn-lnk ui-link"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>2</a></sup>.</p>
      <p>Site characterization involves detailed technical site investigations undertaken to increase the state of knowledge about a particular site. Site characterization involves desktop and both regional and site-specific investigations to identify and provide an understanding of particular features and processes. These processes are typically studied in different disciplines (hydrogeology, rock mechanics, geochemistry, etc.) but should be understood in an integrated manner.</p>
      <p>The data gathered in the preliminary stages of the site characterization may be used to support the initial Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) licence application (i.e., licence to prepare site or a combined licence to prepare site and construct) and form part of the safety case.</p>
      <p>Other regulators will have jurisdiction over activities carried out for site characterization before a site is selected and before an applicant engages in activities that would require a licence from the CNSC. It is recommended that site characterization activities be conducted in consultation with the relevant regulatory bodies early to ensure that regulatory expectations, permitting, licensing or other requirements are clearfixly understood, and that potential issues associated with data acceptance are identified and mitigated.</p>

      <h3 id="sec1-1">1.1 Purpose</h3>
      <p>This regulatory document sets out the CNSC&rsquo;s guidance for licence applicants on technical aspects that may be considered during the site characterization stage of the siting process for a DGR facility for radioactive waste. </p>
    </div>
   
    
    <div class="col-md-12 mrgn-tp-0 mrgn-bttm-0">
      <div id="1.2"></div>
      <h3 id="sec1-2">1.2 Scope</h3>
      <p>REGDOC-1.2.1 provides guidance for a DGR&rsquo;s site characterization process. The guidance in this document focuses on technical matters.</p>
      <p>The CNSC uses a comprehensive licensing system that covers the lifecycle of a DGR &#45; from site preparation to construction, operation and decommissioning (closure and post-closure), and finally, release from the CNSC licence. This approach requires a licensing authorization at each phase, although the site preparation and site construction licence may be combined. </p>
      <p>It is important to note that while in general, site characterization activities will begin before the CNSC&rsquo;s regulatory process, the methods and processes that are used and the data that are collected may form part of future licence applications and will be formally reviewed for quality and adequacy.</p>
      <p>While this document does not provide guidance on finding or selecting a site, the site characterization stage will be carried out at a level sufficient to confirm the technical suitability of a site. </p>
      <p>In this document, the pre-closure period of a DGR encompasses site preparation, construction, operation and decommissioning. The post-closure or long-term period is the period that follows the closure of a DGR facility, with a time frame of tens of thousands of years or more<sup><a id="fnb3a-ref" href="#fnb3" class="fn-lnk ui-link"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a></sup>.</p>
      <p>Note that this document does not: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>apply to surface and near-surface waste management facilities, including waste from uranium mines and mills</li>
        <li>provide guidance on long-term waste management strategies </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
   
    
    <div class="col-md-12 mrgn-tp-0 mrgn-bttm-0">
      <div id="1.3"></div>
      <h3 id="sec1-3">1.3 Relevant legislation</h3>
      <p>The <em>Nuclear Safety and Control Act</em> (NSCA) applies once site preparation activities begin. Accordingly, it is important to be aware of legislation other than the NSCA, such as provincial laws, that might apply to site characterization activity. Facilities for the long-term management of radioactive waste, such as a DGR, are generally licensed under <em>Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations</em>. There is no regulatory process identified in this regulation for selecting a site. The regulatory process is not triggered until an application for a licence to prepare site or combined licence to prepare/construct site is received, which in turn would trigger a federal impact assessment. Note also that the <em>Nuclear Fuel Waste Act</em> is authoritative for Canada&rsquo;s nuclear fuel waste DGR.</p>
      <p>A licence applicant may refer to licence application requirements in the <em>Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations</em> to inform site characterization activities. For example, for a licence to prepare a site, paragraph 4(a) requires the applicant to provide "a description of the site evaluation process and the investigations and preparatory work that have been done and will be done on the site and in the surrounding area &rdquo;and to&rdquo;&#46;&#46;&#46; determine the environmental baseline characteristics of the site and the surrounding area". </p>
      <p>Accordingly, regulatory approvals are not required for site selection, and some site investigation activities will be performed prior to licensing. The "site evaluation process and the investigations and preparatory work that have been done" refer to pre-licensing site characterization activities that are needed to collect enough site-specific data to design and assess the facility and to prepare the required documentation for environmental assessment and/or licensing. The extent of these pre-licensing activities should be discussed with the regulator to avoid initiating activities that require a licence. The purpose for collecting the site-specific data will determine the requirements for data quantity and quality that the site characterization plan should meet. </p>
    </div>
   
    
    <div class="col-md-12 mrgn-tp-0 mrgn-bttm-0">
      <div id="1.4"></div>
      <h3 id="sec1-4">1.4	Early regulatory involvement</h3>
      <p>Early consultation with the regulator for clarity with respect to regulatory expectations and requirements is recommended. Included in this process is the identification of site characterization activities that may not require a licence from the CNSC.</p>
      <p>The extent of consultation between the applicant and the regulator should be balanced in order to preserve the independence of the regulator while providing adequate guidance to the applicant. It is recommended that a service agreement be established between the regulator and the applicant. </p>
      <p>As part of the service agreement, it is recommended that the regulator have the opportunity to conduct informal inspections and assessments&#45; for example, to ensure that a licence applicant&rsquo;s management system is commensurate with the scope of the project, as laid out in CSA standard N286-12, <em>Management system requirements for nuclear facilities</em>. For instance, assessments at this stage could investigate whether management system programs, methods of data collection and contractor procurement are in line with CNSC requirements.</p>
      <p>It is further recommended that the applicant keep the CNSC apprised of key milestones and activities in regard to site characterization activities. Applicants are encouraged to inform the regulator early of potential requests for pre-licensing reviews by the CNSC, such as the site characterization program.</p>
      <p>The CNSC may choose to observe activities or request information. Prior to a formal application being submitted, CNSC staff may also request data, results and materials from the site characterization activities in order, for example, for the CNSC to conduct independent research</p>

      <h2 id="sec2">2. Overview of Siting Process</h2>
      <p>The objective of the siting process, which includes site characterization, should be to select a site that, along with a proper design and engineered barriers, has properties that provide adequate containment and isolation of radionuclides and hazardous substances from the accessible environment for the desired period of time, usually the assessment timeframe<sup><a id="fnb4a-ref" href="#fnb4" class="fn-lnk ui-link"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>4</a></sup>. </p>
      <p>The process for selecting a site and the decision to choose a particular site are the responsibility of the licence applicant.</p>
      <p>The data gathered in the preliminary stages of the siting process may form part of the initial licence application and part of the safety case. Information gathered at this stage may be used as baseline information to support the demonstration of safety throughout the lifecycle of the DGR facility. </p>
      <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) identifies four stages to the siting process for a DGR<sup><a id="fnb4b-ref" href="#fnb4" class="fn-lnk ui-link"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>4</a></sup>:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>a conceptual and planning stage: desktop data compilation and interpretation</li>
        <li>a survey stage: regional mapping and screening</li>
        <li>a site characterization stage </li>
        <li>a site confirmation stage </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Site characterization, the focus of this regulatory document, begins at the earliest stage of the investigation of a site and is expected to become more intensive as the siting process progresses through to confirmation of the site<sup><a id="fnb4c-ref" href="#fnb4" class="fn-lnk ui-link"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>4</a></sup>. </p>
      <p>Note: the transition from one stage to another is somewhat arbitrary owing to the inevitable overlap in siting activities. </p>
      <p>Following confirmation of the site and the initial phases of licensing, characterization activities are normally expected to continue into the site preparation, construction and operational phases. The characterization activities continue through these phases in order to contribute further to an adequate baseline for future monitoring, as well as to help confirm assumptions made in earlier safety cases and reduce any residual uncertainties in the safety case<sup><a id="fnb4d-ref" href="#fnb4" class="fn-lnk ui-link"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>4</a></sup>. Those characterization activities that continue until closure of the DGR are usually defined in a geoscience verification program. The safety case and associated safety assessment should identify uncertainties and assess the robustness of the facility so that the geoscience verification program can be developed and a research program designed and executed to address these uncertainties throughout the lifecycle of the DGR. </p>
    </div>
   
    
    <div class="col-md-12 mrgn-tp-0 mrgn-bttm-0">
      <div id="2.1"></div>
      <h3 id="sec2-1">2.1 Conceptual and planning stage</h3>
      <p>The goal of the conceptual and planning stage is the development of an overall plan for the site selection process and includes the identification of desirable features as a basis for the second stage, as well as the conceptualization of a generic facility design based on the type, volume and radionuclide content of the radioactive waste to be managed (for guidance, see REGDOC-2.11.1, Waste Management, Volume II: <em>Assessing the Long Term Safety of Radioactive Waste Management</em> <sup><a id="fnb5a-ref" href="#fnb5" class="fn-lnk ui-link"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>5</a></sup> and CSA N292.0-14, <em>General principles for the management of radioactive waste and irradiated fuel</em>). Site screening criteria should be developed for selecting or rejecting potential sites, and eventually, a preferred site.</p>
    </div>
   
    
    <div class="col-md-12 mrgn-tp-0 mrgn-bttm-0">
      <div id="2.2"></div>
      <h3 id="sec2-2">2.2	Survey stage</h3>
      <p>The survey stage involves the screening of identified potential siting areas and regional geological mapping and other regional scale characterization activities (e.g., airborne geophysical surveys). Other constraints that should be accounted for include engineering concerns and environmental constraints. The goal of activities carried out at the surveying stage is to inform the screening process, which may narrow down potential sites. </p>
    </div>
   
    
    <div class="col-md-12 mrgn-tp-0 mrgn-bttm-0">
      <div id="2.3"></div>
      <h3 id="sec2-3">2.3 Site characterization stage</h3>
      <p>The site characterization stage involves extensive field work and laboratory study, usually to gather site-specific data on a range of site conditions, including a site&rsquo;s geology, geochemistry and geomechanical suitability. </p>
      <p>Early-stage site characterization activities involve scientific studies and desktop data compilation work, and include activities such as geophysical surveys and borehole drilling, though such activities would stop short of breaking the ground to excavate a shaft.</p>
      <p>Preliminary safety assessments should be completed at this time to test the site&rsquo;s suitability to host a DGR facility, as well as to guide further characterization and confirmation activities. These safety assessments may also form part of a comparative analysis of the remaining site (if applicable), which would lead to the next stage of site confirmation, in which detailed, extensive work would be focused on one site.</p>
    </div>
   
    
    <div class="col-md-12 mrgn-tp-0 mrgn-bttm-0">
      <div id="2.4"></div>
      <h3 id="sec2-4">2.4 Site confirmation stage</h3>
      <p>Site confirmation generally consists of detailed, extensive field and laboratory studies at the selected site. It is at this stage that evaluation of whether sinking a shaft or construction of an underground research facility (URF) may be necessary to obtain more information. </p>
      <p>A final safety assessment should be prepared based on all of the data gathered during prior siting stages and in combination with geological and hydrogeological information, and information about other barriers such as the engineered barrier system, canister design and radioactive waste characteristics. This information may be used to develop the safety case that will be submitted in the initial licence application (i.e., licence to prepare site or combined licence to prepare site and construct).</p>
    </div>
   
    
    <div class="col-md-12 mrgn-tp-0 mrgn-bttm-0">
      <div id="3"></div>
      <h2 id="sec3">3. Site Characterization Program</h2>
      <p>As part of the siting process, the licence applicant should prepare and implement a program for site characterization for the proposed site for a DGR facility. The program should provide information sufficient to support a general understanding of the site in its current state and how it is expected to evolve over extended time frames associated with the safety case [6]. The site characterization program should establish baseline conditions for the site and environment in its present condition; support the understanding of the normal evolution; identify any events and processes associated with the site that might disturb the normal evolution of the DGR system; and support the understanding of the effect on safety of any features, events and processes associated with the DGR system<sup><a id="fnb6a-ref" href="#fnb6" class="fn-lnk ui-link"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>6</a></sup>.</p>
      <p>Data collected during site characterization will form the basis of descriptive site models and geological, hydrogeological, geochemical and geomechanical frameworks that will be relied on to evaluate long-term safety. The data will provide baseline data for detecting potential short- and long-term environmental impacts at various stages and for tracking throughout the CNSC&rsquo;s licensing lifecycle for a DGR. Data needs include relevant regional- and site-scale information.</p>
      <p>Baseline data include the biosphere and geosphere, and support an understanding of current conditions at the site, its geological history, and its likely future evolution over the safety case time frame. These data provide the initial information for safety assessments at the conceptual stage and during initial facility design. They will serve as the basis for the first iteration of the full safety case and any initial geoscience verification program at the site once it has been selected. As well as in the event that development (at any phase) is licensed to proceed. </p>
      <p>The order of the criteria described herein does not imply priority of one element of characterization over another; relative relevance of specific criteria will in some cases be site specific. Specific criteria provided for the collection of baseline data may not be exhaustive and may constitute recommendations. Alternative approaches and innovative techniques that address additional elements of site characterization are also valid. </p>
      <p>In this document, the pre-closure period of a DGR encompasses site preparation, construction, operation and decommissioning. The post-closure or long-term period is the period that follows the closure of a DGR facility, with a time frame of tens of thousands of years or more<sup><a id="fnb3b-ref" href="#fnb3" class="fn-lnk ui-link"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a></sup>.</p>

      <p>The data gathered during the siting phase on the characteristics listed in this section form a significant component of the long-term safety assessments and safety case.</p>
      <p>The characteristics of the geological environment are necessary to assess the long-term safety of a DGR. The key characterization factors of the geological environment should include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>containment and isolation characteristics of the host rock: geological, hydrogeological, mineralogical, chemical and mechanical </li>
        <li>past and future geological stability of the site, including orogeny, seismicity, glaciation and volcanism</li>
        <li>sufficient extent of suitable host rock at the repository depth</li>
        <li>site characteristics that would allow the development of a robust safety case</li>
        <li>demonstrated isolation of groundwaters at selected repository depth from shallow groundwater systems</li>
        <li>characteristics favourable for sorption, precipitation or other mechanisms to limit contaminant release and transport away from a DGR</li>
        <li>low potential for inadvertent future human intrusion</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note that for future NSCA licensing applications, quantitative data should be provided in addition to qualitative descriptions where possible. </p>
      <p>As siting progresses, more extensive geological information would be gathered to verify the initial safety case and to update the safety case iteratively. Although this guidance is focused on the site characterization activities during the siting process, it should be noted that data collection would continue until closure of the DGR, and possibly for some time after closure, in order to verify and update the safety case, and demonstrate long-term safety is maintained. </p>
      <p>The key geological factors that are used to assess the long-term evolution of the repository are demonstrated through the documentation of the following characteristics. </p>

      <ul>

        <li>purpose of each borehole and its intended orientation, length and diameter</li>

      <h3 id="sec5-4">5.4	Integration and interpretation </h3>
      <p>Site characterization involves the quantification and interpretation of a large number of physical and environmental components that interact with each other to a greater or lesser degree. This results in several more or less independent systems of related or interacting components. The components in each system are usually interpreted to develop a site model for that system. For example, the stratigraphy, lithology and spatial distribution of <em>in situ</em> stress can be interpreted to give a conceptual model of both current and evolutionary structural geology of the site, while the distribution of mineralogy in the rock matrix and in fracture infilling can be interpreted to give a separate model of the geological evolution of the site.</p>
      <p>Each scientific and engineering discipline can contribute to one or more independent site models. This is particularly true for geochemistry, in which several independent chemical systems coexist. Since all of these chemical and physical systems coexist at the one site, the independent models derived from each system should be consistent. For example, there should not be inconsistencies between evolutionary models based on mineralization, and dating methods. </p>
      <p>The different site models from different surveys and disciplines, then, should be integrated into a single consistent model of the site&rsquo;s geological and hydrogeological history, current conditions and expected (unperturbed) evolution. The model of current conditions at a site provides the necessary information for design purposes. The history of the site should provide a model of how the site has responded to past perturbations. Extrapolating the history of the site through the current conditions should provide a model of how the site is expected to evolve if not used. Applying estimates of the perturbations imposed by the planned facility and the site response to past perturbations to the model of undisturbed site evolution should provide a model of the anticipated evolution of the site with the facility.</p>
      <p>Such integration and interpretation of the site characteristics are documented in a geosynthesis report, which will constitute an important supporting document to the safety case.</p>

      <h2 id="sec6">6. Facilities for Verification and Characteristic Activities</h2>
      <p>An underground research facility (URF) is an underground facility typically constructed at depth to provide an environment to acquire knowledge and training, help characterize the geology, conduct experiments, test equipment and designs, and help demonstrate feasibility of a DGR.</p>
      <p>Many geoscientific characteristics cannot be obtained from the above-ground activities. Therefore, verification and characterization activities (e.g., underground excavation and research that would typically be carried out in an underground research facility) have been conducted by other countries as a best practice for DGRs for high-level radioactive waste, including used nuclear fuel<sup><a id="fnb8a-ref" href="#fnb8" class="fn-lnk ui-link"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>8</a></sup>. Those activities reduce uncertainties and therefore provide a stronger safety case.</p>
      <p>Setting up an underground research facility is a very time-consuming process, and there may be a significant time lapse between the selection of a potential site and the availability of such a facility at that site. Therefore, it is best practice to start planning for this facility as early as possible in the siting process, and build support and expertise by using available underground research facilities.</p>
      <p>It is important for the licence applicant to discuss its plans with the CNSC early for verification of site characteristics, such as an underground research facility or similar facility, to clarify the regulatory approval process and to identify those site characterization activities. These consultations are also necessary to identify those site characterization activities that may not require a CNSC licence to prepare site and/or licence to construct.</p>
